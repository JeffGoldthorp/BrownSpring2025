He indicated that while progress has been made, the U.S. still faces significant digital vulnerabilities, largely due to close commercial ties with China. He advocated for the U.S. to restructure its policies regarding network security in light of its competition with China. Lewis also highlighted the strategic importance of technologies like 5G and 6G, which underpin the future global interconnected digital infrastructure essential for economic growth. This technology-driven competition has become a new field for international rivalry."}]}

China, despite its authoritarian political system, is competitive in areas like artificial intelligence, quantum communications, satellites, and 5G spectrum allocation. Western countries are increasingly trying to reduce China's role in their supply networks due to political risks and espionage concerns. Chinese espionage is at unprecedented levels, surpassing Cold War activities, leveraging global connectivity and extensive surveillance systems. The interdependence between Western and Chinese companies complicates efforts to change this commercial and technological relationship."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant knowledgeable on geopolitical and cybersecurity issues."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you elaborate on China's approach to espionage and how it impacts other countries?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "China has a long-standing policy of espionage, targeting both its own citizens and foreign nations, particularly the United States. According to Lewis' testimony before the E&C Subcommittee on Communications & Technology on February 15, 2024, China's intelligence agencies are well-resourced and highly innovative, making them formidable opponents. The 2017 National Intelligence Law is a key component of this framework, mandating that all Chinese citizens and entities support the state's intelligence activities, even outside China. This law has no appeal process and is not transparent, meaning that companies can be compelled to cooperate without resistance. This creates significant challenges for global cybersecurity as nations struggle to keep up with advancements in cyber espionage. A notable example of such espionage is the 2015 hack of the Office of Personnel Management, where Chinese intelligence accessed vast databases of Americans' personal information."}]}

This operation was part of a broader data-centric intelligence effort by China to enhance their 'big data' programs for intelligence gathering. The hack primarily supplied China with data to improve the identification of Chinese citizens who are US informants. This aligns with China's extensive efforts in data analytics and biometrics to advance their surveillance initiatives. Beyond domestic targets, these efforts also focus on foreign entities, particularly the U.S. The OPM hack underscores the complexities of Chinese network espionage, shaped by the long-standing tech interdependence between the West and China. This relationship is fraught with issues related to China's expansive economic growth, strategic technological investments, and international policy challenges."}]}

As a key supplier in the interconnected digital supply chain, China could exploit this position for intelligence purposes or to degrade or deny access to vital technologies. The interconnected nature also means that Chinese information technologies and services could be used in ways that harm American national security and privacy. Efforts by the Department of Commerce's Office of Information and Communications Technology and Services aim to manage these risks. However, due to the deep interconnection between Western and Chinese technology markets, decoupling is not a feasible solution in the near term."}]}

This is a concern because of China's government investments, industrial espionage, and the decisions by Western companies to relocate manufacturing to China. These factors contribute to Chinaâ€™s significant presence in the digital technology supply chain. Moreover, software vulnerabilities arise from the way software is often written using a mix of proprietary, open source, and third-party modules, some of which may originate from Chinese sources. These vulnerabilities are exploited by hackers, highlighting the need for improved disclosure or reporting mechanisms for software from foreign entities considered adversarial to the United States. Addressing this situation requires time and gradual reduction of interdependencies, yet it is a necessary step towards enhancing cybersecurity."}]}

Unlike the smaller, less globally integrated industries of the DPRK, Iran, or Russia, China exerts a significant influence through its expansive presence in hardware, software, applications, and increasingly, cloud services. Chinese leaders, particularly under President Xi, aim to maintain the Chinese Communist Party's power by reshaping international affairs and asserting China's dominance, with information technology serving as a central tool in this strategy. For the U.S., critical infrastructure and government software and technology acquisitions face certain risks of hostile actions from China, as Chinese software on internet-connected devices presents potential access points for Chinese intelligence agencies. Identifying software with Chinese components is challenging, but utilizing a 'Software Bill of Materials' (SBOM) managed by the Department of Homeland Security can help discern and evaluate the risks and benefits of such software."}]}

Increasing transparency in the source of digital technology is crucial for risk assessment. Legislation for studying national security risks posed by devices like routers and modems is proposed, given their vulnerability and potential to grant access to corporate networks.\n\nRecently, the Department of Justice disrupted a network of small office or home office routers allegedly used by China for potential attacks on critical infrastructure. Additionally, software development kits (SDKs) from major Chinese companies such as Tencent are embedded in numerous American apps, which could expose sensitive data to foreign adversaries.\n\nThe U.S. Administration's focus on secure software development, especially post the Solar Winds incident, is aimed at mitigating these risks. However, reducing vulnerabilities due to technological interdependence with countries like China will require time and dedicated effort to shrink exploit opportunities."}]}

The Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019, which bans federal funding for Huawei and ZTE equipment, marks a starting point. However, decoupling from China is not feasible due to the deep interconnections built over the last 40 years. Therefore, a strategy focusing on managing the risks, including using authorities like the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), is essential. Broader solutions could involve national privacy laws, supply chain transparency, and restricting certain high-risk Chinese technologies. These steps aim to mitigate technology dependence risks while recognizing that not all Chinese technology poses the same level of threat."}]}

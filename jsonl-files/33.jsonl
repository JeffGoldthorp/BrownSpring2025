This technique observes relationships between DNS request and response messages to identify suspicious activities. However, a limitation is that legitimate traffic might be flagged as suspect, especially if the detection runs on the same DNS server as the malicious domain. Signature-based and anomaly-based detection technologies also analyze DNS logs to detect remote management of infected clients. Despite identifying various DNS characteristics and creating reputation engines to spot compromised IP addresses, these strategies can falter if an attack, like a Trojan resolving directly to an IP, doesn't involve domains. Commercial tools like Kaspersky’s Anti-targeted Attack Platform and Bitdefender’s Gravity Zone are used, yet these rely heavily on signature-based detection and sandboxing, resulting in false positives and limited effectiveness against user-interaction-based attacks, such as phishing."}]}

Multi-stage attacks involve several discrete actions performed by one or more attackers to achieve a single objective within a network. Unlike a simple attack, where similar actions are repeated, multi-stage attacks comprise various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). An example is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), where the attacker methodically progresses through stages, using different strategies at each step. Models like Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain, and others by Dell, LogRhythm, Mandiant, and BSI, illustrate these stages. The Cyber Kill Chain, a seven-step model, describes an attack’s lifecycle, helping organizations identify potential entry points and devise countermeasures. These models, which include SDAPT and others, share a common concept, usually divided into phases that cover establishing a foothold, gaining remote access, and subsequent actions the attacker takes to achieve their final goals."}]}

Although not all attacks follow each phase explicitly, these models are useful references for predicting attackers' goals and next moves. \n\nThe phases often reflect methods of entry into the network, such as weaponization, targeting, or installation, and are usually associated with the attackers' objectives like reconnaissance actions. It's important to note that attackers may not always use well-known techniques, as seen with the APT Stuxnet, which can perform activities autonomously without needing connection to a command and control (C&C) server. Therefore, detection techniques should not only focus on activities and objectives but also on the phase of vulnerability exploitation, ensuring that the APT has not gained a foothold within a target network."}]}

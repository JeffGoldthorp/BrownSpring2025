IT Outage from CrowdStrike ’s Update : Impacts to Certain 
Public Safety Systems an d Considerations for Congress
On July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, 
released  a software update to their customers . The update  
caused  certain  systems to crash , disrupt ing services across 
several industries, including airlines , banks, hospitals, 
government  agencies, and public safety systems.   
CrowdStrike reported that the incident was caused by  “a 
defect found in a single content update of its software on 
Microsoft Windows operating systems” and was not a 
cyberattack. Though the update affected less than 1%  of all 
Windows machines, the impacts were widesprea d and 
global . The  incident  illustrates the vu lnerabilities of 
information technology ( IT) systems, increased dependence 
and risks in relying on third -party vendors for critical IT 
services, and lack of protocols and backup systems in the 
event of IT system fail ures.  
This In Focus  discusses the incident’s  impact on certain 
U.S. public safety communications systems and services .  
Impact on Public Safety Systems  
The incident  affected public safety agencies that use 
CrowdStrike ’s cybersecurity software on their computer 
systems . This i ncluded some 911 systems ; police and fire 
agenc y systems ; fire alarms;  and broadcast  networks , some 
of which play a role in emergency alerting . It also affected  
the computers and operations of some federal agencies that 
support public safety  agencies and emergency response . 
Select ed 911 Systems and Services  
The CrowdStrike update  reportedly  affected  public safety 
systems and services in certain jurisdictions across several 
states. In some areas  (examples below) , 911 centers were 
able to receive voice calls, but their computer systems were 
not operational.  
• In Phoenix , AZ, the police department reported  the 
outage affected their computerized 911 dispatch 
center —people could still call the 911 center and calls 
were being answered, but caller information was 
recorded manually rather than through the 
computerized dispatch system . 
• In Portland , OR, the mayor’s office announced  some of 
the city’s computers and servers were affected, 
includ ing the Bureau of Emergency Communication 
computer -aided dispatch (CAD) system —people could 
still make voice calls to the 911 center, but the center 
had to switch to  taking calls  manual ly rather than 
answering calls using its computerized system.  
In other areas  (examples follow ), the update reportedly  
affected 911 calling .  • In Alaska, state troopers announced  911 systems were 
not operating correctly due to the incident  and posted 
alternative pho ne numbers to call in lieu of 911 . 
• In Middletown , OH, police issued a notice to the public 
of its inability  to receive 911 calls and offered 
alternative phone number s.  
Other jurisdictions reported no impacts  to 911  services .  
Other Public Safety -Related Systems  
In some areas  (examples below) , the faulty CrowdStrike 
update  affected other public safety -related systems.   
• In Columbus , OH, police reportedly  were unable to 
access data from terminals in their vehicles , including 
law enforcement data systems and license plate 
information, and firefighters were unable to receive 
dispatch information in their vehicles . 
• In Ocean City , MD, fire alarms that automatically 
contact the fire department upon detection of a fire 
reportedl y were affected.  
Federal Agencies Support ing Public Safety  
• A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) manager 
reported  that some staff encountered  issues loggin g 
into desktop computers but were able to work through 
phones, virtual desktop, or web-based  applications.  
• DHS’s Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) reported  some issues with its systems, but an 
agency spokesperson said , “there are no impacts to 
FEMA’s critical or immediate lifesaving and life -
sustaining operations. There is also no evidence of any 
data loss.” FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and 
Warning System (IPAWS) and the Emergency Alert 
System were reportedly  working normally; however, 
some broadcasters  whose stations  may play a role in 
distribution of alerts and warnings were af fected.  
Impact on Telecommunications  Systems  
Public safety agencies rely on commercial 
telecommunication networks as an additional means of 
communications , for prioritization of calls  for officials , and 
for 911 calling and emergency alerting. Telecommunication 
networks seemingly were not affected  by the incident . 
People were able  to make calls and communicate on 
landline and cell phone networks. IT systems of some  
telecom providers who use CrowdStrike ’s service  were 
affected, leading to some disruption of bus iness operations 
and customer service , but networks remained operational . IT Outage from CrowdStrike’s Update: Impacts to Certain Public Safety Systems and Considerations for Congress  
https://crsreports.congress.gov  The incident  was similar to a February 22, 2024 , outage of 
the AT&T wireless network  in that  both were caused b y a 
faulty software update, and both affected public safety 
systems. The events  were different in that AT&T was 
updating its own network, whereas CrowdStrike —a third -
party vendor that provides cybersecurity services to 
companies and government agencie s—was updating its 
client -end software on its customers’ computers .  
Future Public Safety  Considerations  
In a 2017  white paper on telecommunications secur ity, 
Oracle, a U.S.-based computer networking technology 
company, explained that telecommunication networks were 
“designed in a different era,” where a small set of operators  
managed the physical interconnection  of networks  and 
network security. The emergence of Internet Protocol  
(IP)—the set of rules for addressing and routing data over 
the internet —enabled interconnectivity between many 
networks, creating  the global internet  and the ability for IP-
based networks and device s to interconnect . With the 
adoption  of IP -based devices (e.g., smartphones, smart 
TVs), Oracle reports, “now virtually anyone can purchase 
or gain access to networks ,” creating new risks.   
The telecommunication s and public safety sectors  have 
been migrating to IP -based network s and software -defined 
networks  to enhance network management and performance  
and enable interconnectivity . One example  is Next 
Generation 911 (NG911), which  allows  for advanced 
capabilities , such as text-to-911 and other multimedia 
communications (e.g., videos), improve d call routing,  
enhance d location -finding , and interconnection with other 
911 centers.  While NG91 1 enabl es interconnectivity 
between 911 centers , enhancing redundancy and resiliency , 
it also introduce s new vulnerabilities, including cyber risks. 
Some companies address cyber risks internally, protecting 
their devices, networks, and data through their own  IT 
solutions . Others adopt third -party vendors to protect their 
systems. CrowdStrike is a third -party vendor providing 
such services. Use of third -party vendors for critical IT 
services create s another risk for network operators in that 
any outage  caused by or to a third -party provider or supplier 
also presents risks. In this case, dependence on 
CrowdStrike, a large cybersecurity firm  that offers its 
services globally, explain s the widespread outage.  
The incident  demonstrates  the need for cybersecurity 
detection and services a s well as  the heavy reliance that 
entities , including public safety agencies, may have on one 
vendor. The risk is that when the vendor releases a software 
update over the internet, it can affect many computers and 
many entities  at once , including public safety agencies . As 
more public safety systems move toward IP -based systems , 
more entities may rely o n network -based , third -party 
services  to address cyber risks . In this context,  it may be 
important for public safety agencies to increase attention to 
and investment in backup protocols and systems that allow 
entities  to maintain continuity of service  during outages . 
Executive Branch  Response  
The White House reportedly  has been  assessing the impact 
of the incident on federal IT, critical infrastructure, and public safety systems and to industry. DHS ’s Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ) announced  that 
it was  working closely wi th CrowdStrike and  with federal, 
state, local, tribal , and territorial partners, as well as  with 
critical infrastructure and international partners to assess 
impacts and support remediation efforts . The Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) reported  it was 
working with other federal agencies to assist with the 
disruptions and assess the extent of the impact  on 911  
services .  
Congressional Response  
Some Members and committees have responded to the 
Crowd Strike incident . The chair and a subcommittee chair 
of the House Committee on Homeland Security  wrote a 
letter  requesting that CrowdStri ke schedule a hearing with 
the subcommittee. Some Members of the House Oversight 
and Accountability and House Energy and Commerce 
Committee s reportedly have separately  requested briefings 
from CrowdStrike.  
Considerations for Congress  
Congress may seek to a ssess and address potential new 
risks and backup considerations for public safety agencies , 
particularly as Congress consider s funding for the transition 
to NG911. For instance, Congress could direct  
• DHS’s CISA  to work with public and private partners 
to identify and assess risks to public safety systems and 
recommend mitigation methods and best practices to 
avoid outages  of public safety  systems . 
• National Institute of Standards and Technology to 
develop recommendations  for minimum standards  for 
testing and release protocols for software updates  as it 
does for software testing and security . 
Congress also could provide or prioritize funding for 
critical infrastructure resiliency , including  for public safety 
backup system s.  
While the FCC regulates  telecommunications service  
provider s and requires reporting of outages  that may affect 
911 services, it has limited regulatory authority  over 
internet service providers or IT service providers that 
support public safety communications (e.g., 911, alerting). 
The FCC recently has sought comment  on a proposal to 
require broadband internet access providers to report on 
outages during disasters ; the FCC  cited public  safety  
dependenc ies on the internet . Congress may consider 
policies to ensure internet outages , such as  
telecommunication s outages, are timely reported and 
communicated to public safety system operat ors (e.g., 911 
centers, alerting a gencies , police and fire departments).

1I. SUMMARY
The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) Modernization Act requires the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) IPAWS Program Management Office to conduct 
tests of the public alert and warning system.1  On October 4, 2023, FEMA, in coordination with the 
Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC), conducted nationwide tests of Wireless 
Emergency Alerts (WEA) and the Emergency Alert System (EAS).2  The purpose of these tests was to 
ensure that WEA and EAS “continue to be effective means of warning the public about emergencies, 
particularly on the national level.”3  
The following report presents the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau’s (PSHSB) 
analysis of how the EAS and WEA performed during the nationwide test, based on the information we 
have available.4
WEA Performance
Based on stakeholders’ survey data shared with the Commission, most respondents reported 
successful receipt of the WEA test message.5  The test also highlighted areas where WEA delivery can be 
improved, such as ensuring more consistent delivery and resolving issues concerning alert message audio 
tone and vibration cadence. 
EAS Performance
The nationwide test demonstrated that the large majority of EAS Participants – radio and 
television stations, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite (DBS), Satellite Digital Audio 
Radio Service (SDARS), digital audio broadcasting systems, and wireline video systems6 – reported 
successful receipt and retransmission of the nationwide test.  The test demonstrated that the national EAS 
distribution architecture is largely effective as designed.  As anticipated, the test also shed light on

included working with Georgia Tech’s Center for Advanced Communications Policy, which “assembled a 
nationwide panel of about 10,000 people with disabilities to learn more about whether they received the test, in what 
format, and their location, among other things, to better understand access challenges.”  See Georgia Tech, School of 
Public Policy, Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, Georgia Tech Researches Studying National Wireless Alert Test

2operational readiness failures that prevented some EAS Participants to receive and/or retransmit the test 
alert.  The overall results of the 2023 nationwide EAS test, based upon data collected from the FCC’s 
EAS Test Reporting System (ETRS) and outreach to FEMA and State Emergency Communication 
Committee (SECC) representatives, demonstrate the following:
•The test message was received by 96.6% of EAS Participants (increase from 89.3% in 2021).  
The overall retransmission success rate was 93.6% (increase from 87.1% in 2021).  This 
significant improvement is likely due to initiation of the 2023 test alert via Common Alerting 
Protocol (CAP), which introduced additional resiliency that was not available during the over-
the-air-only 2021 nationwide test.
•While test participants reported less than one-third as many performance complications as 
compared to 2021, more test participants reported equipment configuration issues and equipment 
failures.
•At the time of the test, approximately 23% of EAS equipment units representing over 4,500 EAS 
Participants, were either using outdated software or were using equipment that no longer 
supported regular software updates.  Test results demonstrated that fully up-to-date equipment 
had the highest receipt and retransmission rates (97% and 95%, respectively), whereas equipment 
with software that is no longer supported had the lowest receipt and retransmission rates (90% 
and 85%, respectively).
•Five of the six poorest-performing geographic regions were territories of the United States.  
These territories were the Northern Mariana Islands (20.0% retransmission success), Guam 
(33.3% retransmission success), American Samoa (66.7% retransmission success), the U.S. 
Virgin Islands (88.9% retransmission success), and Puerto Rico (89.7% retransmission success).
Based on these results, PSHSB recommends that the Commission adopt rules to improve the 
operational readiness of EAS Participants and Participating CMS Providers, as well as ensure that EAS 
Participants are installing software updates in a timely manner and have plans for replacing equipment 
that is no longer supported by the manufacturer.  PSHSB also recommends actions that EAS Participants 
and Participating Commercial Mobile Service Providers should take to improve the reliability and reach 
of WEA and the EAS, including in the territories of the United States.  PSHSB also recommends that 
Congress require all CMS Providers to support WEA.
II. BACKGROUND
WEA and EAS are invaluable communications alerting tools.  They provide the President with a 
means to address the American public during times of national emergency.  They also provide authorized 
federal, state, and local alert originators an effective means to transmit local and/or statewide emergency 
alerts,7 such as severe weather alerts and America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) 
Alerts.8  The Commission, in conjunction with FEMA, implements WEA and EAS at the federal level.
Wireless Emergency Alerts.  WEA is a tool for authorized federal, state, local, Tribal and 
7 The term “alert originator” refers to a federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local entity authorized by FEMA to use 
IPAWS to issue critical public alerts and warnings in emergency situations.  See FEMA, Alerting Authorities, 
https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public-safety-
officials/alerting-authorities/agencies-organizations (last updated Oct. 31, 2023).

3territorial government entities to geographically target alerts and warnings to the WEA-capable mobile 
devices of participating commercial mobile service providers’ subscribers.9  The Warning Alert and 
Response Network (WARN) Act10 establishes WEA as a voluntary system in which commercial mobile 
service (CMS) Providers may elect to participate and gives the Commission authority to adopt “relevant 
technical standards, protocols, procedures and other technical requirements necessary to enable 
commercial mobile service alerting capability for commercial mobile service providers that voluntarily 
elect to transmit emergency alerts.”11  While participation by wireless providers is voluntary, those 
commercial mobile service providers that choose to offer the service (Participating CMS Providers) must 
adhere to the technical and operational requirements established by the Commission.12  For example, the 
Commission’s rules require Participating CMS Providers to receive and transmit four classes of Alert 
Messages: National Alert (formerly known as a “Presidential Alert”); Imminent Threat Alert; Child 
Abduction Emergency/AMBER Alert; and Public Safety Message.13  The Commission’s rules also 
require that National Alerts must always be presented,14 by WEA-capable mobile devices, i.e., unlike the 
other three classes of alerts, which mobile devices can be opted out of receiving.15  
Since its launch in 2012, WEA has been used to issue more than 86,000 emergency alerts, 
including severe weather warnings, evacuate and shelter-in-place alerts, and AMBER alerts.16  More 
information about WEA can be found in the Appendix to this report.  
Emergency Alert System.  The Commission’s rules require EAS Participants to have the 
capability to receive and transmit a National Emergency Message (EAN), formerly known as a 
Presidential Alert, disseminated over the EAS.17  There are two methods by which EAS alerts may be 
distributed.  Under the traditional broadcast-based distribution structure, the EAS transmits an alert 
through a pre-established hierarchy of broadcast, cable, and satellite systems, starting with the initial 
delivery to 72 National Public Warning System (NPWS) stations, also known as Primary Entry Point 
(PEP) stations.  This first method is the EAS Protocol, a messaging protocol that delivers basic alert 
elements over the air.18  The EAS Protocol lacks the capability to deliver separate audio and non-English

term commercial mobile service as any mobile service (as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153) that is provided for profit and 
makes interconnected service available to the public or to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available 
to a substantial portion of the public, as specified by regulation by the Commission.  See 47 U.S.C. § 332(d)(1).

4text files and is dependent on radio reception for the quality of the audio,19  but it serves as a reliable 
means of disseminating alerts to the public in situations in which IP-based services may not be 
available.20  The second method of distribution is over IPAWS, which is a FEMA-operated alert 
aggregator that authorized alert originators use to send WEA alert messages to Participating CMS 
Providers and EAS alerts to EAS Participants.  IPAWS alerts are formatted in the more sophisticated 
Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  CAP-formatted alerts initiated through IPAWS can include audio, 
video or data files, images, non-English translations of alerts, and links providing detailed information.21  
The Appendix to this report contains additional information about the EAS, including a description of 
how the alerts are disseminated over the EAS.  
III. THE 2023 NATIONWIDE WEA TEST
The Parameters of the Nationwide WEA Test
This test marks the third nationwide WEA test, but only the second directed to all WEA-capable 
cellular devices.22  To reach all mobile devices the WEA portion of the test was sent as a National Alert,23 
which subscribers cannot opt out of receiving.24  The test message was sent to all consumer cellphones in 
the United States and its territories.25  The test 90-character message read: “THIS IS A TEST of the 
National Wireless Emergency Alert System.  No action is needed.”26  The 360-character message read: 
“THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. The purpose is to maintain and 
improve alert and warning capabilities at the federal, state, local, tribal and territorial levels and to 
19 The EAS Protocol uses a four-part message for an emergency activation of the EAS.  The four parts are: Preamble 
and EAS Header Codes; audio Attention Signal; message; and Preamble and EAS End Of Message (EOM) Codes.  
See 47 CFR § 11.31.  These parts can inform the public as to the nature, location, effective times, and originator of 
the alert.  See FCC, PSHSB, Report: September 28, 2016 Nationwide EAS Test at 3 (2016), 
https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344518A1.pdf (discussing the value added from Internet-based 
alert distribution).

Order, 27 FCC Rcd 642, 655, para 27 (2012).
21 The Commission’s rules require EAS Participants to be able to receive alerts from both IPAWS and the broadcast-
based EAS structure.  See 47 CFR §§ 11.52(d), 11.56(a).  EAS Participants can deliver to the public the rich data 
contained in a CAP-formatted message received directly from the IPAWS Internet feed, but when the alert is 
rebroadcast over the daisy chain, the CAP data are lost, and EAS Participants receiving the alert over the air cannot 
transmit CAP-based features, such as digital audio or multiple languages, to the public.

25 See FEMA 2023 Waiver Request at 1.  Mobile device users in Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands did not receive the WEA portion of the test because they do not have a CMS 
provider who participates in WEA.  See Guam Homeland Security: Office of Civil Defense, Nationwide Emergency

5evaluate the nation's public alert and warning capabilities. No action is required by the public.”27  The test 
message also was sent in Spanish, in both a 90-character version and a 360-character version.28  Per the 
Commission’s rules at the time of the test, Participating CMS Providers were required to transmit the alert 
message in both English and Spanish.29  The test alert message should be displayed in the device’s default 
language.  The Spanish-language versions of alerts should only be displayed to wireless subscribers 
whose device settings specify Spanish as the preferred language.30  
Key Observations from the Nationwide WEA Test
NYCEM Survey.  Following the nationwide EAS test, the New York City Emergency 
Management Department (NYCEM) administered a survey via the Notify NYC emergency 
communications program, social media, and partner engagement.31  NYCEM reported that of 1,405 
responses received, 94.2% of respondents reported receiving the WEA test message.32  The 5.8% of 
respondents who reported they did not receive the WEA test message provided a number of explanations, 
including: spotty service; on the subway/lacking cellular coverage; mobile phone turned off; phone in 
airplane mode; phone on “Do Not Disturb”; and using the phone for a voice call.  44% of respondents 
cited no known reason for not receiving the message. 33   For those respondents who did not receive a 
WEA message, 7.7% listed AT&T as their wireless provider, 18.5% listed T-Mobile, 33.8% listed 
Verizon, 15.4% listed “Other,” and 24.6% provided no response.34  NYCEM’s survey also revealed 
approximately 19.4% of respondents who received the WEA test did not receive the full WEA test with 
complete sounds/haptics, of which 49.2% did not have their devices set on vibrate and/or silent.35 
FCC Complaints.  The Commission received seventy-seven informal complaints from the public 
in response to the nationwide test.  The complaints included: (1) non-receipt of the test alert message; (2) 
the inability to opt out of receiving the test; (3) the loudness of the audio attention signal; and (4) missing 
tone and/or vibration.  The Commission also received several informal complaints that the test alert 
message was received in Spanish when the device user expected to receive it in English.

6PSHSB Letters to Wireless Providers.  On September 11, 2023, the Chief of the Public Safety and 
Homeland Security Bureau sent letters to the nine largest cellular providers that participate in WEA: 
AT&T; Best Buy Health; Cellcom; C Spire; DISH; Google Fi; T-Mobile; US Cellular; and Verizon.  The 
letters requested written responses regarding the performance of carriers’ networks during the test.  The 
letters to Best Buy Health; Cellcom; C Spire; DISH; Google Fi; and, US Cellular asked if the provider (1) 
received the test alert message and transmitted it to its subscribers; (2) experienced any complications or 
anomalies with its WEA capability; and (3) took any efforts to observe or evaluate WEA performance 
during the test.36  The letters to AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon asked those questions as well as several 
additional questions about WEA performance.37  The responses to the Bureau’s letters revealed the 
following information:  
•The providers reported receiving the test alert from FEMA IPAWS as early as 14:18:03 EDT and 
as late as 14:18:12 EDT.38
•The providers transmitted the test alert message as early as 14:18:04 EDT and as late as 14:18:19 
EDT.39
•Several providers experienced “anomalies” during the test:
oAT&T reported a fiber cut that affected nearly thirty (30) physical sites in the Dallas/Fort 
Worth and West Texas markets.  Service was restored approximately seven (7) minutes 
after the initiation of the test.  Once service was restored, the alert would have been 
transmitted to those subscribers that did not receive it.40
oBest Buy reported that eight subscribers did not receive the test alert message.41  One of 
its Jitterbug Flip 2 devices in San Diego, CA did not emit the audio attention signal and 
vibration cadence. 
oT-Mobile subscribers (and subscribers to Mobile Virtual Network Operators who take 
service from T-Mobile) reported receiving the WEA test alert message in Spanish even 
though they had not changed the device’s default language of English. 42  The issue was 
limited to Android devices running the Android R or newer Operating System, which 
have since been patched to address this issue.

than “National Alert.”43
oVerizon reported that 1.663 seconds elapsed between receipt of the test alert message 
from FEMA IPAWS and Verizon’s transmission of the test alert message to subscribers 
due to the large number of cell sites in their network and the need for the two mated Cell 
Broadcast Entity facilities to coordinate the delivery of the English and Spanish versions 
of alert.44 
To the extent a nationwide WEA activation can be compared to the multiple local activations 
used during the 2022 WEA Performance exercise, the responses from AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon 
revealed that the issues seen in the 2022 WEA Performance Exercise did not recur during the 2023 
nationwide test.  For example, during the 2022 test, Verizon reported that two redundant Virtual Privatge 
Network paths between FEMA IPAWS and Verizon failed.45  Meanwhile AT&T reported that it observed 
five instances where FEMA IPAWS incorrectly sent the alert to AT&T’s inactive Cell Broadcast Center 
(CBC) in Allen, TX, rather than the correct CBC in Bothell, WA.46  Neither provider reported a similar 
occurrence during the 2023 Nationwide Test.47
IV. THE 2023 NATIONWIDE EAS TEST
The Parameters of the 2023 Nationwide EAS Test
This test marks the seventh nationwide EAS Test.48  For this test, the nationwide test alert was 
disseminated as a Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) message via FEMA’s IPAWS.49  The test message 
audio and text, which was designed to be identical to the greatest extent possible, was as follows: “This is 
a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
covering the United States from 14:20 to 14:50 hours ET. This is only a test. No action is required by the 
public.”50  Each EAS Participant received the alert either directly from IPAWS by polling the IPAWS

8Internet feed, or via a re-broadcast of the alert by the source that it monitors in the EAS “daisy chain.”51  
In this approach to relaying emergency alerts, a group of selected EAS Participants in each of the 72 
NPWS stations’ broadcast area, known as Local Primary (LP) stations, monitor these NPWS stations.  
When LP stations receive an alert they, in turn, broadcast the alert in their listening areas.  The remaining 
broadcasters, cable television facilities, and other EAS Participants receive the alerts from NPWS, LP, or 
other stations they are required to monitor and deliver the alerts to the public.  
Participation in the Nationwide EAS Test
At the time of the 2023 nationwide EAS test, there were approximately 25,306 EAS Participants 
in the United States and its territories.52  This estimate includes analog and digital radio broadcast stations 
(including AM, FM, and Low Power FM (LPFM) stations); analog and digital television broadcast 
stations (including Low Power TV (LPTV)); analog and digital cable systems; wireless cable systems; 
wireline video systems;53 DBS services; and SDARS.54
Table 1 summarizes the participation rate in the 2023 nationwide EAS test.55  Excluding 
duplicate filings,56 EAS Participants made 20,682 unique filings,57 with a participation rate of 81.7% up 
from 75.3%, in 2021.58  Radio broadcasters had a participation rate of 85.1%, up from 79.9% in 2021, 
51 Participants’ EAS equipment polls the IPAWS server to check for new alerts at regular intervals.  If an EAS 
Participant receives an over-the-air alert before it checks IPAWS, the over-the-air alert is retransmitted.  Beginning 
in December 2023, EAS Participants are required, upon receiving a legacy EAS alert message, to check whether a 
CAP version of an over-the-air alert is available by polling the IPAWS feed for CAP-formatted EAS messages.  If a 
CAP version is available, EAS Participants must transmit the CAP version rather than the legacy version.  Because 
this category applies to all EAS alerts except those with the EAN, NPT, or Required Weekly Test (RWT) event 
codes, this requirement is not applicable to nationwide tests.  See 47 CFR § 11.55(c)(2).
52 This total consists of the 17,363 radio broadcasters and 4,029 television broadcasters in the FCC’s Consolidated 
Database System, and the 3,914 headends active in the FCC’s Cable Operations and Licensing System.  This 
methodology likely overestimates the number of radio and television broadcasters that participate in the EAS, as 
some are exempted from the Commission’s rules that govern EAS.  For example, if a hub station satisfies the EAS 
requirements, an analog or digital broadcast satellite station that rebroadcasts 100% of the hub station’s 
programming would not be required to file in the EAS Test Reporting System (ETRS).  See 47 CFR § 11.11(b).

55 Throughout this report, data are calculated to the nearest tenth, which, in some instances, results in percentage 
totals just slightly under or over 100%.  
56 EAS Participants submitted 25,805 filings in 2023.  5,123 of these filings duplicated facilities for which EAS 
Participants had already filed.  The total number of filings include the cumulative tabulation for all forms received 
from a filer.  For example, if a test participant submitted Forms One, Two and Three through ETRS, this would be 
recorded as one filing, rather than three separate filings.
57 Unique filings are a set of filings that represent the report of a single EAS Participant facility, such as a radio 
station or a cable headend, with any duplicate filings removed.  Most duplicate filings were submitted for cable 
systems.  To the extent that EAS Participants’ filings indicate that a headend serves alerts using multiple, 
independent sets of EAS equipment, each set of equipment is considered as a unique headend for purposes of this 
report.  
58 See 2021 Nationwide EAS Test at 6.  For purposes of this report, participation rate is defined as the number of 
unique filings received from a specified EAS Participant type divided by the total number of EAS Participants of 
that type.  Federal Communications Commission
9while television broadcasters’ participation rate was 74.5% up from 62.6%, in 2021.59  Cable systems, 
Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), and wireline video system participants had a participation rate of 
73.8% up from 67.9%, in 2021.60  No wireless cable systems filed in 2023, while four wireless cable 
system participated in 2021.

Table 2 provides an overview of the form types submitted in ETRS.  Form One asked EAS 
Participants to report basic identifying information, such as ownership or licensee contact information, 
EAS designation as identified in their State EAS Plan, and the make, model, and software version of their 
EAS equipment.  Form Two asked EAS Participants to report “day of test” results, including whether 
they had successfully received and retransmitted the test alert.  Form Three asked EAS Participants to 
report more detailed test results, such as the first source from which the alert was received, the language 
in which the alert was received, and details of any issues experienced during the test.  89.3% of test 
participants completed Forms One, Two, and Three, as required by the Commission’s rules, which is up  
from 87.8% in 2021.63  4.4% of test participants submitted “day of test” results in Form Two but failed to 
submit the detailed results required by Form Three, which is a smaller percentage than 2021’s 8.9% that

61 The Commission has determined that test result data submitted by EAS Participants be treated as presumptively 
confidential.  See Review of the Emergency Alert System, EB Docket No. 04-296, Sixth Report and Order, 30 FCC 
Rcd 6520, 6533, para. 27, note 90 (2015) (noting that test data received from EAS Participants or any reports that 
contain individual test data shall be treated as presumptively confidential).  Accordingly, Table 1 and others in this 
report reflect aggregated test result data so that no confidential information is revealed.  As referenced throughout 
this Report, PSHSB does not provide data for very small groups of EAS Participants and does not include them 
among the total number of filings.  The omission of this data does not change the assessment of the test in any 
significant way.

Table 3 compares the filing rate of Low Power broadcasters to that of all broadcasters and non-
LPFM/TV broadcasters.64  LPFM participation in the test (61.6%) was lower than that of non-LPFM 
broadcasters (87.5%) and radio broadcasters overall (84.6%), but higher than 2021’s participation rate 
(49.5%).  Similarly, LPTV participation (68.0%) was lower than that of non-LPTV broadcasters (78.6%) 
and television broadcasters overall (73.6%), but higher than 2021’s participation rate (47.4%).  As with 
the 2021 test, the low participation rate of Low Power broadcasters reduced the overall participation rate 
of broadcasters.  Of the 2,680 radio broadcasters that were expected to file but failed to do so, 759 
(28.3%) were LPFM Broadcasters.  Of the 1,063 television broadcasters that were expected to file but 
failed to do so, 604 (56.8%) were LPTV broadcasters.65

EAS Participant Monitoring of IPAWS
All EAS Participants are required to monitor IPAWS.66  ETRS Form One asked EAS Participants 
to confirm whether their facility’s equipment complied with this requirement.  Table 4 shows that 97.5% 
of test participants reported that they are complying with the IPAWS monitoring requirement—a slight 
increase from 97.4% in 2021.67  However, the raw number of participants monitoring IPAWS increased

On ETRS Form Three, EAS Participants identified the first source from which they received the 
test alert.  Table 5 compares the sources from which the different types of test participants received the 
test alert.  A majority (63.6%) of test participants reported to have first received the alert from IPAWS 
and a minority (36.4%) first received the alert over-the-air.  Television Broadcast providers reportedly 
first received the alert via IPAWS more frequently than other participant types (70.6%).

Breakdown of Test Performance by EAS Participant Type
In ETRS Form Two, the Commission asked EAS Participants whether they had successfully 
received and retransmitted the test alert on October 4, 2023.  Table 6 shows test participants’ success 
rates for alert receipt and retransmission.  When compared to performance during the 2021 test, a majority 
of EAS Participant categories saw a noticeable improvement.  This is due in large part to the inclusion of 
CAP messaging in the 2023 test. The 2021 test only utilized over-the-air messaging to distribute the EAS 
message.  With the inclusion of CAP in the 2023 test, EAS Participants were also able to receive the 
message over the Internet.  
This data indicates that, overall, 96.6% of test participants successfully received the alert which is 
an increase from the 2021 success rate of 89.3%.  The overall retransmission success rate of 93.6% is an 
increase from 87.1% reported in 2021.  97.0% of radio broadcasters successfully received the alert an 
increase from 88.8% in 2021, and successful retransmissions improved to 94.7% when compared to the 
87.0% success rate in 2021.  Television broadcasters reported that 95.6% (up from 90.1% in 2021) 
successfully received the alert and 89.3% (up from 86.0% in 2021) successfully retransmitted it.  
Similarly, 95.0% (up from 90.8% in 2021) of cable systems successfully received the alert and 92.7% (up 
from 88.7% in 2021) successfully retransmitted it. Federal Communications Commission

14Equipment Performance
An analysis of equipment and software information within ETRS filings revealed that as of early 
October 2023, over 4,500 EAS Participants, approximately 23% of EAS equipment units, were either 
using outdated software (17%) or operating equipment that were no longer supported with regular 
software updates (6%).  The remaining 77% of EAS equipment units reported by EAS Participants were 
fully up-to-date.  
Fully up-to-date equipment had the highest performance results, whereas equipment using 
software that is no longer supported had the lowest performance results.  Of the EAS Participants that 
reported using EAS equipment units that PSHSB determined are no longer supported with software 
patches, 90% reported successfully receiving the alert and approximately 85% reported successfully 
retransmitted the alert.  Notably, approximately 5% of these EAS participants reported successful receipt 
of the alert but failed to retransmit the alert, likely indicating an equipment-related complications 
occurred.  Of the EAS Participants that reported using EAS equipment units that PSHSB determined are 
outdated but can receive software patches, 95% reported successfully received the alert and 
approximately 90% reported successfully retransmitted of the alert.  EAS Participants with fully up-to-
date EAS equipment units reported that approximately 97% successfully received the alert and 
approximately 95% successfully retransmitted the alert. 
Language of Alert
Form Three asked EAS Participants to report the languages in which they received and 
retransmitted the test alert.  Table 8 shows the language of the alerts that were received and retransmitted 
by test participants.  The test alert message was sent in both English and Spanish.  The table below 
reflects the number of test participants who elected to transmit the alert to their audience in Spanish.69  
More radio and television broadcasters reported receiving and retransmitting the test alert in either 
Spanish only or both Spanish and English than reported such receipt or retransmission in 2021.  The most 
marked increases were in radio broadcasters that received and retransmitted the test alert in English and 
Spanish, which were reported by three and eight radio broadcasters, respectively, in 2021, compared to 25 
and 33 radio broadcasters, respectively, in 2023.

Test participants also reported the primary languages in their service area.  Table 9 tallies the 
three highest reported service area languages or combination of languages.  Of the 13,966 responses 
received from EAS Participants, 13,297 (95.2%) reported English as the primary language in the service 
area, while 398 (2.8%) reported both English and Spanish, and 226 (1.6%) reported Spanish only as the 
primary language in the service area.  This year, 18 other languages were reported in smaller numbers, 
including Russian, Chinese, Korean, Samoan, Navajo, Portuguese, Polish, Vietnamese, Creole, French, 
Hebrew, Hindi, Arabic, Amharic, Somali, Yup’ik/Cup’ik and Inupiaq/Yup’ik.

V. ANALYSIS OF MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
The Nationwide EAS Test: Complications
Test participants reported complications with the test that included equipment configuration 
issues, performance issues, audio quality issues, alerting source issues, and clock errors.  As in previous 
years, EAS Participants reported the complications they experienced in two ways.  First, ETRS Form 
Three provided a series of checkboxes that allowed EAS Participants to assign categories to the issues 
they experienced.  These categories were based on the complications observed in previous nationwide 
EAS tests, which included audio quality issues, equipment performance issues, software update issues, 
and user error.70  Second, Form Three allowed EAS Participants to offer more detailed descriptions of the 
complications through the use of explanatory text fields.

Of the 18,334 test participants, 17,187 reported through checkboxes that they experienced no 
complications during receipt (93.7%).  16,338 (89.1%) test filers reported they experienced no 
complications during retransmission.  In 2021, 12,275 (64.0%) reported by checkbox that they 
experienced no complications during receipt, and 13,328 (69.5%) test filers reported the same during 
retransmission.  Table 10 shows the categories of complications reported by test participants through 
checkboxes.  Of the 18,334 test participants, 1,147 reported through checkboxes that they experienced at 
least one issue during receipt 1,996 test participants reported that they experienced at least one issue 
during retransmission.  In all, participants reported 612 issues in receipt and 909 issues in retransmission 
through checkboxes.

3. Monitoring Source Issues
ETRS filings revealed that of 72 NPWS stations, two stations (approximately 3%) experienced 
technical issues receiving and retransmitting the alert on the test day, a decrease from seven of 76 NPWS 
stations in 2021 (approximately 9%).  ETRS filings also revealed that these stations failed to receive the 
CAP alert via IPAWS as a result of Internet issues.  One station specifically cited that their broadband 
Internet service provider was experiencing an outage, and the other cited that the Internet was “very 
slow.”  These stations did not successfully receive the nationwide alert from the over-the-air sources that 
they monitored.  
Table 12 shows EAS Participant performance by state and territory.  Five of the six poorest-
performing geographic regions were territories of the United States.  These territories were the Northern 
Mariana Islands (20% retransmission success), Guam (33.3% retransmission success), American Samoa 
(66.7% retransmission success), the U.S. Virgin Islands (88.9% retransmission success), and Puerto Rico 
(89.7% retransmission success).  The majority of explanations reported by these territories cited the 
following complications: equipment performance issues, transmission not received, equipment 
configuration issues, and Internet issues.  Notably, approximately 35% of the equipment used in these five 
US territories was outdated, which we believe could be a contributing factor to poor performance.  Rhode 
Island was the state with the highest number of alert receipt complications in the explanatory fields with 
33.3% of the filings indicating either audio or equipment issues.  States with the highest performance 
results for both alert receipt and retransmission were reported by Vermont (VT) and Delaware (DE) 
which both reported 100% successful receipt, and 98.9% and 100% successful retransmission, 
respectively. Federal Communications Commission

As a practical matter, one way for EAS Participants to reduce complications due to failure to 
receive the test alert, such as the complications discussed above, is to ensure that they monitor several 
independent sources of alerts.  Multiple monitored sources add redundancy to the system so that when 
one source fails, a test participant can still successfully receive the alert from elsewhere and retransmit it.  
We note that the Commission’s rules require EAS Participants to monitor two EAS sources for EAS 
messages that are formatted in accordance with the EAS Protocol, in addition to requiring monitoring of 
IPAWS.  We are aware that many EAS Participants already monitor multiple broadcast-based sources.  
However, we continue to emphasize the importance of multiple monitoring sources as required by our 
rules.  We also recommend that stations located far from NPWS stations consider the viability, 
technically and otherwise, of satellite sources of the broadcast alert.
4. Equipment Performance Issues
There were 348 test participants that reported equipment performance issues on receipt and 832 
on retransmission involving non-working equipment.  Participants cited that the equipment was out for 
repair, failed during the test, was missing, malfunctioned, was damaged/broken, outdated, or was in the 
process of being replaced.  Approximately 30% of the test participants that reported equipment 
performance issues on receipt, and approximately 20% of test participants that reported equipment 
performance issues on retransmission, were using EAS equipment units with either outdated software or 
operating equipment that no longer supports software updates.  Specific examples of equipment 
performance issues that were observed by outdated or no longer supported EAS equipment units included 
failure to connect to IPAWS, the ability to receive the alert but failure to retransmit the alert, and 
explanations that older equipment was not functional or compatible with other system components.  As Federal Communications Commission
21evidenced by these results, it is critically important that EAS Participants that are widely monitored use 
testing to ensure their EAS equipment is in reliable working order and outdated equipment and/or 
software is updated to the latest version or replaced to mitigate performance related complications and 
safeguard against security vulnerabilities. 
5. Accessibility Issues
Individuals with disabilities and organizations representing people with disabilities submitted 
observations to the FCC regarding issues relating to the accessibility of alerts. Informal feedback was also 
obtained from input directly emailed to the Commission.72  Filers noted that the manner in which the EAS 
test message was displayed in some cases was not accessible to people with disabilities.73  Specifically, 
filers reported that some EAS text crawls were overlapping with closed captions, too fast, not accessible 
due to a low contrast ratio between the text color and background color, too small, or unclear/blurry.  One 
informal complaint was received regarding a station’s selection of visually inaccessible font and 
background colors, and this complaint was resolved by the station to the satisfaction of the filer.  While 
these issues largely mirrored those identified in the 2021 Nationwide EAS Test Report,74 there were fewer 
complaints regarding specific television stations.
6. Text Crawl Issues
There were 38 participants on retransmission that cited experiencing text crawl issues during 
retransmission.  Test participants cited no onscreen crawl and audio only but no text crawl.  
7. Audio Issues 
There were 159 test participants on receipt and 204 on retransmission that explained their station 
experienced complications with receipt or retransmission of the alert due to audio issues.  Many test 
participants reported background noise, static, no tone/audio, low volume audio, only tones and no 
message, multiple audio tones, short audio duration, and/or unintelligible/distorted audio. 
8. Equipment Configuration 
There were 103 test participants on receipt and 94 on retransmission that provided explanations of 
EAS equipment configuration issues.  Participants in this category cited user-related configuration 
problems, including invalid firmware and improper connection to monitoring sources, incorrect tuning, 
and lack of software upgrades.  Most test participants that reported complications related to equipment 
configuration also reported that they had successfully identified and corrected the cause of those 
complications or were fixing it immediately
9. Clock Issues 
There were 84 test participants on receipt and 93 on retransmission who explained that an 
incorrect time setting within the EAS equipment caused complications with the ability to receive or 
72 See, e.g., Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, Access Survey Report: IPAWS National Test 2023 (Dec. 
14, 2023), https://disasterstrategies.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Report-IPAWS-2023-Survey-Report-
accessible.pdf.  In this survey with over 400 respondents, the majority of respondents who received the WEA and 
EAS messages found them easy to understand.  The survey also provides anecdotal reports of barriers to 
accessibility by some respondents. 
73 See 47 CFR § 11.51.  
74 2021 Nationwide EAS Test Report at 19.Federal Communications Commission
22retransmit the EAS message.  Test participants noted that the time or time zone was set incorrectly, 
equipment clock was off, and/or the incorrect date was configured.  For example, if the EAS equipment’s 
time was not correctly synchronized to real time, it would not receive nor retransmit the EAS message, as 
the equipment would consider the message to have expired.
10. Internet Issues 
There were 65 test participants on receipt and 39 on retransmission that had internet outages 
during the test.  Participants in this category cited IP provider being down, Internet service down, Internet 
connection issues, and Internet firewall problems. 
11. Power Issues
There were 35 test participants on receipt and 28 on retransmission that explained they were 
having power outages or issues during the time of the test.  Most respondents citing power issues stated 
these outages were a result of local power outages at tower site, power supply failure/malfunction, or 
battery failure.
12. Signal Issues 
There were 30 test participants on receipt and two on retransmission that reported complications 
receiving or retransmitting the test message due to poor signal.  Test participants attributed the poor signal 
reception issues, or weak signal from their monitoring source.
13. XML Digital Signature Issues
There were 23 test participants on receipt and 17 on retransmission that cited their station 
experienced complications due to XML digital signature issues that caused complications with receiving 
or retransmission of the alert.  Most respondent cited that the IPAWS XML certification was 
invalid/expired or failed due to an invalid XML digital signature.
14. Lightning
There were 10 test participants on receipt and 12 on retransmission that explained their station 
was affected by lightening which hindered their ability to received and/or retransmit the test.  Lightning 
issues included damaging equipment necessary for broadcasting.  
15. Antenna Issues 
There were seven test participants on receipt and five on retransmission that reported they 
experienced complications with receipt and/or retransmission of the test signal because the antenna failed, 
was damaged, or was improperly positioned to receive the monitoring source.
16. Low Power
There were 11 test participants on retransmissions stated that they were a Low Power station and 
did not have a responsibility to retransmit.  Low power stations are required to broadcast the alert, though 
they are not required to have equipment capable of generating the EAS codes and Attention Signal.75  
75 See 47 CFR 11.51(a), (e) and 11.61(a)(3)(1).  Federal Communications Commission
23VI. NEXT STEPS
The Bureau will continue to take measures to improve the EAS.  To help address areas for 
improvement highlighted by the 2023 nationwide WEA and EAS tests, the Bureau will continue to 
address commonly reported operational complications and improve participation in the nationwide test. 
Specifically:
•PSHSB recommends that the Commission adopt rules to improve the operational readiness of 
EAS Participants.  The 2023 nationwide test revealed that 6.4% of EAS participants failed to 
retransmit the alert.  Additionally, 4.5% of EAS participants reported experiencing some kind of  
equipment related complication during retransmission of the alert.  It is essential that the entire 
public be able to successfully receive alerts in order to take protective action during emergencies.  
Failure to transmit an alert and deliver life-saving information to affected communities during a 
real emergency puts the public at risk.
•PSHSB recommends that Commission adopt rules to ensure that EAS Participants are updating 
their EAS equipment’s software and have a plan for replacing equipment that is no longer 
supported.  As of early October 2023, over 4,500 EAS Participants, approximately 23% of EAS 
equipment units, were either using outdated software or operating equipment that no longer 
supported regular software updates.  The 2023 test also revealed that fully up-to-date equipment 
had the highest receipt and retransmission performance results (97% and 95%, respectively), 
whereas equipment with equipment that is no longer supported had the lowest receipt and 
retransmission performance results (90% and 85%, respectively).  The use of equipment with 
older software or equipment that no longer receives manufacturer support increases the risk of 
alert failure as well as poses major security risks.
•PSHSB recommends that its staff engage with EAS Participants in the territories of the United 
States to improve EAS performance.  The 2023 nationwide test results showed that EAS 
Participants reporting from these territories, including the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, 
American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico were among the lowest performers for 
both alert receipt and retransmission.  These territories in particular have been plagued by 
multiple tropical storms and typhoons in recent years including Super Typhoon Mawar affecting 
Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in late May 2023,76 and Hurricane Fiona affecting Puerto 
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto in September 2022.77  PSHSB will work closely with 
EAS Participants and SECCs, and if necessary help reinvigorate SECCs and pursue enforcement 
actions, to ensure that EAS is effective in these territories. 
•PSHSB recommends that its staff work with FEMA to evaluate ways to improve the accessibility 
of EAS text crawl.  Filers reported that some EAS text crawls were not accessible due to 
circumstances such as overlapping with closed captions, scrolling too fast, having a low contrast 
ratio between the text color and background color, were too small, or were unclear/blurry.  It is 
important that EAS Participants take steps to identify and correct these issues before EAS is 
needed during an emergency.
•PSHSB recommends that Congress require all CMS Providers to support WEA.78  As discussed 
above, 44% of respondents who reported they did not receive the WEA test message did not 
know why the alert was not received.  Requiring all CMS Providers to support WEA would

24enhance public safety by ensuring greater consistency in the delivery of life-saving alerts to the 
public, making it a more reliable and effective warning tool for alerting authorities nationwide. 
•PSHSB recommends that the Commission adopt rules to improve the operational readiness and 
software updating practices of Participating CMS Providers.  Similar to the performance observed 
for EAS, 5.8% of respondents to NYCEM’s survey reported they did not receive the WEA test 
message and some providers reported that they experienced technical failures during the test that 
prevented members of the public from receiving the alert.  Just like in receiving EAS messages, it 
is essential that the entire public be able to successfully receive WEA alerts in order to take 
protective action during emergencies, and PSHSB finds that further action is necessary to ensure 
WEA’s availability and reliability.  
VII. CONCLUSION
The 2023 nationwide WEA and EAS test successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of WEA 
and the EAS as alerting tools, as well as the capability of IPAWS to disseminate these alerts to the public 
through the nation’s alert and warning infrastructure.  This year’s test also highlighted several areas in 
which WEA and the EAS can continue to improve and additional actions that should be taken to ensure 
that these systems are as effective as they can be.  The Bureau will continue to work with FEMA, EAS 
Participants, and other EAS stakeholders to improve the system and ensure that it remains effective and 
can transmit timely and accurate nationwide alerts to the public when they are needed the most.  Federal Communications Commission
25APPENDIX: HOW WEA AND EAS WORKS
Wireless Emergency Alerts
In 2008, pursuant to the Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act,79 the Commission adopted 
rules allowing CMS Providers to voluntarily deliver timely and accurate emergency alerts over 
subscribers’ mobile devices.80  The WARN Act required that the Commission undertake a series of 
actions, including the establishment and convening of an advisory committee to recommend technical 
requirements for WEA.81  Accordingly, the Commission formed the Commercial Mobile Service Alert 
Advisory Committee (CMSAAC).82  The CMSAAC submitted its report to the Commission on October 
12, 2007, as required by the WARN Act.83  The Commission subsequently promulgated rules governing 
WEA, within the timeframes established by the WARN Act.84  The WARN Act gives the Commission 
authority to adopt “relevant technical standards, protocols, procedures and other technical requirements 
based on the recommendations of such Advisory Committee necessary to enable commercial mobile 
service alerting capability for commercial mobile service providers that voluntarily elect to transmit 
emergency alerts.”85  The WARN Act also gives the Commission authority to adopt procedures whereby 
CMS Providers could specify their intent to the Commission to participate in WEA.86  76 CMS Providers 
79 On October 13, 2006, the President signed the Security and Accountability for Every Port (SAFE Port) Act into 
law.  Title VI of the SAFE Port Act, also known as the WARN Act, establishes a process for the creation of a 
national mobile alerting system, now known as WEA, whereby Participating CMS Providers transmit emergency 
alerts to their subscribers.  See Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act, Title VI of the Security and 
Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006, 120 Stat. 1884, codified at 47 U.S.C. § 1200, et seq. (2006) (WARN 
Act).

26elect to participate in WEA, at least in part.87  Since its launch in 2012, the WEA system has been used 
more than 86,000 times to warn the public about dangerous weather, missing children, and other critical 
situations – all through alerts on compatible cell phones and other mobile devices.
The WEA system is a tool for authorized federal, state and local government entities to geographically 
target National Alerts, Imminent Threat Alerts, AMBER Alerts, and Public Safety Messages to the WEA-
capable mobile devices of Participating CMS Providers’ subscribers.88  As depicted in Figure 1 below, a 
WEA Alert Message is sent by an authorized federal, state or local government entity using the Common 
Alerting Protocol (CAP) to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-operated Alert 
Aggregator via a secure, Internet-based interface (the A-Interface) where it is authenticated, validated and 
subsequently delivered to FEMA’s Alert Gateway (the B-Interface).89  At the FEMA Alert Gateway, the 
Alert Message is prepared for delivery to the Participating CMS Provider by being converted to 
Commercial Mobile Alert for C-Interface (CMAC) format to render it readable by WEA-capable mobile 
devices.  The Alert Message is then disseminated across a secure Internet-based interface (the C-
Interface) to the Participating CMS Provider’s Alert Gateway (CMSP Gateway) for distribution to mobile 
customers over cell broadcast (CMSP Infrastructure).90
87 See FCC, Master WEA Registry, https://www.fcc.gov/files/weamasterregistry112019xls; PS Docket No. 08-146 
(containing a record of all Participating CMS Providers’ elections to participate in WEA).  
88 See, e.g., 47 CFR § 10.450 (geo-targeting); § 10.430 (character limit); § 10.400 (classification).
89 See infra Figure 1 (WEA Architecture).  CAP is an open, interoperable, XML-based standard that can include 
multimedia such as streaming audio or video.  See OASIS CAP v1.2 (IPAWS Profile for the OASIS Common 
Alerting Protocol IPAWS USA).  CAP messages contain standardized fields that facilitate interoperability between 
and among devices.  See id.
90 From a technical standpoint, the WEA system currently deployed by FEMA and Participating CMS Providers is 
based on standards created by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), the 
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) (jointly, ATIS/TIA), and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 
(3GPP).  See CSRIC IV WEA Messaging Report at 7.  We note that nothing in the WARN Act or the Commission’s 
rules requires WEA to be a cell-broadcast-based service.Federal Communications Commission
27Figure 1. WEA Architecture
Currently, Participating CMS Providers’ WEA infrastructure removes Alert Message metadata, including 
a description of the geographic target area for the Alert Message and the Alert Message’s expiration time, 
and then transmits the Alert Message content to their subscribers’ WEA-capable devices.  While the 
Commission’s WEA rules are technologically neutral, most Participating CMS Providers use cell 
broadcast technology to transmit WEA Alert Messages to their subscribers.91  When the Alert Message is 
received by a WEA-capable mobile device, it is prominently presented to the subscriber as long as the 
subscriber has not opted out of receiving Alert Messages of that type.92  
91 See CSRIC V, Working Group Two, Wireless Emergency Alerts – Recommendations to Improve Geo-targeting 
and Offer Many-to-One Capabilities, Final Report and Recommendations 8 (2016); but see Letter from Rebecca 
Murphy Thompson, EVP and General Counsel, Competitive Carriers Association, to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, 
FCC, PS Docket No. 15-91, at 2 (filed Oct. 10, 2017) (stating that some carriers offer WEA using a software 
application, rather than cell broadcast).  
92 See Joint ATIS/TIA CMAS Mobile Device Behavior Specification (ATIS-TIA-J-STD-100).  Subscribers’ right to 
opt out of WEA Alert Message receipt extends to all but the National Alert.  See 47 CFR § 10.280.

28The Emergency Alert System
The EAS is designed primarily to provide the President with the capability to communicate via a live 
audio transmission to the public during a national emergency.93  The EAS is the successor to prior 
national warning systems Control of Electromagnetic Radiation (CONELRAD), established in 1951; and 
the Emergency Broadcasting System (EBS), established in 1963.94  The FCC, in conjunction with FEMA 
and the NWS, implements EAS at the federal level.95  The respective roles these agencies play are defined 
by a 1981 Memorandum of Understanding between FEMA, NWS and the FCC;96 a 1984 Executive 
Order;97 a 1995 Presidential Statement of EAS Requirements;98 and a 2006 Public Alert and Warning 
System Executive Order.99  As a general matter, the Commission and FEMA work closely with radio and 
television broadcasters, cable providers, and other EAS Participants and stakeholders – including state, 
local, territorial and tribal governments – to ensure the integrity and utility of the EAS.
FCC rules require EAS Participants to have the capability to receive and transmit National Emergency 
Message alerts (EANs) disseminated over the EAS, and generally govern all aspects of EAS 
participation.100  EAS Participants also voluntarily transmit thousands of alerts and warnings issued 
annually by the NWS and state, tribal, and local governments, these alerts typically address severe 
weather threats, child abductions, and other local emergencies.  As discussed in more detail below, non-
National Emergency Message EAS alerts do not require that EAS Participants open a live audio feed from 
the alerting source, but rather transmit alerts with prerecorded messages that can be delivered at the 
discretion of the EAS Participant, rendering non- National Emergency Message alerts (and their related 
testing procedures) inappropriate for end-to-end testing of a nationwide alert.101
93 See Review of the Emergency Alert System, Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 25 FCC Rcd 564, 
565, para. 2 (2010).
94 CONELRAD was not an alerting system per se but was rather a Cold War emergency system under which most 
radio and television transmission would be shut down in case of an enemy missile attack to prevent incoming 
missiles from homing in on broadcast transmissions.  The radio stations that were allowed to remain on the air, the 
CONELRAD stations, would remain on the air to provide emergency information.  See “Defense: Sign-off for 
CONELRAD,” Time Magazine, Friday, July 12, 1963.
95 FEMA acts as Executive Agent for the development, operation, and maintenance of the national-level EAS.  See 
Memorandum, Presidential Communications with the General Public During Periods of National Emergency, The 
White House (September 15, 1995) (1995 Presidential Statement).

29Broadcast-Based Distribution of EAS 
There are two methods by which EAS alerts may be distributed.  Under the broadcast-based distribution 
structure, illustrated in Figure 2 below, the EAS is designed to cascade the National Emergency Message  
through a pre-established hierarchy of broadcast, cable, and satellite systems.  FEMA initiates a 
nationwide, National Emergency Message alert using specific encoding equipment to send the EAN code 
initially to the Primary Entry Point (PEP) stations over a secure telephone (wireline) connection.102  PEP 
stations are privately owned commercial and non-commercial radio broadcast stations that cooperatively 
participate with FEMA to provide emergency alert and warning information to the public before, during, 
and after a national or local emergency.103  Upon receipt of the code, the PEPs open a live audio channel 
to FEMA and broadcast the National Emergency Message throughout their listening areas.  A group of 
selected EAS Participants in each PEP’s broadcast area, known as Local Primary (LP) stations, monitor 
these PEP stations.  When LP stations receive the National Emergency Message , they, in turn, open up an 
audio channel to FEMA via the PEP, and broadcast the National Emergency Message  in their listening 
areas.  The remaining broadcasters, cable television facilities and other EAS Participants located in each 
LP’s broadcast footprint receive the alerts from the LP stations, transmit the alerts to the public (or in the 
case of cable, to customers’ set top boxes), and open up the audio channel to FEMA through their PEP 
and LP.  
Figure 2. EAS Architecture
102 The EAN and other EAS codes are part of the Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) protocol used both for 
the EAS and NOAA weather radio.  See National Weather Service, “NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards,” available 
at https://www.weather.gov/sgf/nwr_same.

also information about PEP stations at https://www.fema.gov/national-public-warning-system (last visited Jan. 3,

up communications equipment and power generators designed to enable them to continue broadcasting information 
to the public during and after an event.  Id.

30Alerting via IPAWS
EAS and WEA alerts may be distributed over the Internet through the Integrated Public Alert and 
Warning System (IPAWS), illustrated in Figure 3 below.104  As of June 30, 2012, EAS Participants are 
required to be able to receive EAS alerts formatted in Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)105 from 
authorized emergency alert initiators over the Internet via IPAWS.  CAP-formatted alerts can include 
audio, video or data files, images, multilingual translations of alerts, and links providing more detailed 
information than what is contained in the initial alert (such as streaming audio or video).106  An EAS 
Participant that receives a CAP-formatted message can utilize the CAP-formatted content to generate 
messages in synchronous audio and visual formats, which then can be broadcast to local viewers and 
listeners.107  CAP also provides each alert with a unique alert identifier and supports alert authentication

 5 EXECUTIVE SUMM ARY 
This study highlights the complexities behind the notion of cyber crisis and the degree of 
subjectivity it involves. The elevation of a large -scale cyber incident into a cyber crisis 
relies predominantly on a political decision , and depends  largely on the level of risk that EU 
Member States (MS) are prepared to tolerate (i.e. ‘ risk appetite’). 
Differences in interpretation of what constitutes a cyber crisis between MS pose challenges at 
the EU level. The definition of cyber crisis is important as it directly influences the way the  crisis 
is managed. In the meantime, identifying the causes, natur e and impact  of a cyber crisis can 
facilitate the assessment of the crisis and its severity, and influence the selection and adoption 
of appropriate measures for cyber crisis management.  
The management of a cyber crisis involves a variety of actors at the organisational  or 
corporate , sectoral , regional , national  and EU levels . A cyber crisis is managed at  the 
strategic , operational  and technical  levels , with the operational level playing a key role in 
bridging the gap between the other two, ensuring that information is shared at all levels and 
enhancing cooperation and coordination between all relevant stakeholders. In addition, cyber 
crisis management frameworks are part and parcel of general crisis  management 
frameworks.  As a result, the EU has a complex ecosystem of cyber security actors,  
structures and mechanisms,  with a  ‘highly complex and interwoven system of actors, 
structures and processes operating in the cyber domain’, mainly  because cyber crises are often 
transboundary by nature.  
While the EU has developed a crisis management framework specifically dedicated to the 
management of cyber crises  – including through the Blueprint for coordinated response to 
large- scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents and crises (2017)  (Blueprint)  (1), the 
Cybersecurity Act  (2019)  (2) or the network and i nformation security  (NIS ) directive  (2016)  (3) – 
the NIS 2 directive (NIS2) (4) has the strongest impact on cyber crisis management at the 
strategic, operational and technical levels in the EU . At the operational level, it will 
consolidate ENISA ’s support to M S (5) in cyber crisis management, introduce new obligations 
for MS and assert the EU -Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network (EU -CyCLONe) as the 
key player in cyber crisis management. NIS2 enables a more coordinated approach through 
greater cooperation between  MS and relevant EU institutions, bodies and agencies 
(EUIBAs) . 
In this study, cyber crisis management at the operational level in the EU is analysed around the 
four phases of the cyber crisis management cycle, namely prevention, preparedness,

 6 response and  recovery,  which should be framed by an all -hazards approach , given that 
threats can have many different origins.  
The best practices identified show that MS have already introduced some effective cyber crisis 
management measures at the operational level. These are likely to continue to grow and 
evolve, as MS implement NIS2 and develop their own responses to the challe nges of cyber 
crisis management.  
The identified best practices are shown below.  
The prevention phase aims to better prevent and reduce the risk of cyber crises and to minimise their effects should they arise.  
• BP #1 . Adoption of a national definition of ‘ cyber crisis’ , taking into account its transboundary 
dimension.  
• BP # 2. Development of information security standards specific to the national public sector, to 
be reviewed and updated regularly.  
• BP # 3. Foster national initiatives which promote the creation  of prevention programmes such 
as centralised distributed denial -of-service  attack ( DDoS ) mitigation programmes . 
 
The preparedness phase aims to develop plans to support response operations . 
• BP # 4. Definition of a governance structure, provision of specific capabilities and appointment 
of a crisis coordinator, whose nomination is mandatory under NIS2, ensuring their 
department has the necessary operational and technical cyber skills to directly coor dinate 
stakeholders during a cyber crisis.  
• BP # 5. Mapping and gathering information on critical entities and their most critical assets to 
enable rapid action.  
• BP # 6. Establishing instantaneous, secured communication channels during a crisis . 
• BP #7 . Formal isation of a clear allocation of roles between the parties involved in responding 
to a cyber crisis in an overall plan.  
• BP #8 . Development of escalation criteria for activating the cyber crisis plan and deploying the 
relevant cooperation units/groups, taking into account factors such as time, priority, players 
involved, severity of the attack, etc.  
• BP #9 . Development of a methodology and risk assessment tools to optimise coordination 
and interoperability in the event of a crisis.  
• BP #10.  Testing of  the overall plan for operations in response to cyber crises through a 
multiannual programme of cyber crisis management exercises and t raining  session s. 
• BP #11.  Setting up training sessions for current and future staff responsible for cyber crisis 
management at the operational level.  
• BP #1 2. Development of a communication strategy including a clear format for messaging, 
stakeholders to involve, priority levels and time factor and communication channels to be 
used.  
The response phase aims to stem the cyber crisis and prevent further damage.  
• BP #13. Encourage the mobilisation of private -sector certified  ‘trusted providers ’ to provide 
technical assistance to victims.  
• BP #1 4. Supporting victims ’ crisis communication , for instance with a unified and transparent 
message.

 7 The recovery phase aims to enable quick recovery through tailored measures and return 
to a level of security that is normal or even higher than before the crisis.  
• BP #1 5. Develop and implement b usiness resumption plans (BRP) defined in reference 
frameworks, with regular reviewing and updates, in consultation with relevant stakeholders.  
• BP #1 6. Establishment of a unit tasked with gathering feedback, drawing lessons learnt and 
producing recommendations for reviewing, updating and modifying procedures and infrastructure, and  refining the action plan for cyber crisis management.  
Based on the analysis and the way forward of the best practices  (
6), EU -CyCLONe could 
consider the following recommendations . 
Recommendation #1 . Coordinate working sessions involving all MS to define a list of EU -wide 
cyber crisis mechanisms to enable a common assessment of incidents and identify the players 
to be involved depending on the severity of the incident, leading to a model cyber crisis 
response plan. These cyber crisis management mechanisms could be regularly updated in line 
with progress made by the MS, particularly in terms of human and technical resources, 
situational awareness and impact assessment. They should always be part of over arching 
national crisis management frameworks, considering the transboundary nature of most crises and the potential for spill -over effect s impacting many sectors at the same time.  
Recommendation #2 . Develop simulation exercises at the EU level which test the operational 
level players and procedures in particular. These exercises, which should involve all three levels 
(strategic, operational and technical), aim to practice the allocation of tasks, cooperation and 
fluidity of action of the MS during a cyber crisis. Actors in charge of cyber crisis management 
must know each other well to trust one another. To ensure continuity, coherence and overall 
consistency, each exercise could be organised on the basis of the results of the previous one. The exercises would thus test the operational level ’s ability to coordinate and exchange 
information, assess the situation, act as the computer security incident response team’s  
(CSIRTs ) interpreter with political decision -makers, and manage crisis communication with 
stakeholders. EU -CyCLONe can play a key role not only in strengthening capacity -building but 
also developing long-lasting trust among MS.  
Recommendation #3 . Support MS in the set -up of secure communication platform(s) to 
exchange with essential entities, including for informal communication, during a cyber crisis. 
While the platforms selected by MS should obviously be the result of national choices, EU -
CyCLONe could help said choices by publishing guidelines, and even comparative analyses, about the messaging systems best suited to cooperate and exchange information in complete 
confidentiality.  
Recommendation #4 . Ensure that MS national cyber crisis management  authorities, in 
coordination with the NIS Cooperation Group (
7), regularly update critical information system 
(IS) maps of essential entities in their country. To do so, they could encourage essential entities 
to send regular updates, in particular durin g IS change or update of projects. Precise maps are 
essential for cyber crisis management, enabling more effective operational coordination in the event of an incident. They contribute to a rapid reaction in the event of an incident, to qualify the 
impact,  or to prevent the consequences of the defensive actions carried out.  
Recommendation #5 . Support the organisation of media training sessions for executives of MS 
national cyber crisis management authorities, so that they can give coherent and clear updates  
on the progress of the crisis, in any type of media (press, radio, TV, social networks). As each

 9 1. INTRODUCTION 
 EU POLICY CONTEXT  
EU policy  and legislation  framing  cyber  crisis  management  have  evolved  significantly  in response to a 
fast-evolving  threat  landscape,  with the EU actively  engaged in shaping a comprehensive cyber  crisis  
management  framework.  The EU has adopted a proactive stance,  acknowledging  the potential  impact  
of cyber  incidents  on the internal  market,  public  security,  and society  across  MS. Strengthening 
European crisis  management  governance involves  fostering effective  cooperation amongst  operational  
actors  within  the EU, including  the creation of synergies  between national  authorities,  MS and EU 
institutions,  bodies,  agencies.  A key policy  measure was enacted  in 2016 with the NIS directive.  Taking 
account  of the many  different  crisis  response  mechanisms  across  EU institutions,  the Blueprint  
attempted  to present,  for the first time,  a possible  EU-wide  concept  to responding  to cybersecurity  
incidents  too large for one or two MS or EU institutio ns to handle.  The EU framework  further  progressed 
with key legislative  texts  including  the Cybersecurity  Act and the NIS2  directive  (2022),  which  
supersedes  the Blueprint  and underlines  the critical  need for cybersecurity preparedness  and 
effectiveness  in addressing the escalating ‘ number,  magnitude,  sophistication,  frequency,  and impact  of 
incidents ’. Most  recently,  the EU established  EU-CyCLONe,  tasked with enhancing  cooperation and 
c
oordination  between relevant  actors,  overcoming  the gap between the strategic  and technical levels,  
preparing decision- making  at the political  level and coordinating cyber  crisis  management,  situational 
assessment  and mitigation action measures  in case  of massive  cyber  incidents.  
 STUDY CONTEXT  
In the wake of the adoption of NIS2 in 2022, this study aims to identify tried and tested practices 
(best practices ) in cybersecurity crisis (cyber crisis) management at the operational level in the 
EU. It provides an understanding of the specifics of cyber crises, a concept which is understood differently in MS, and of the management thereof at the operational level. It provides insights 
into key actors, capabilities and procedures to prevent, detect, respond to and recover from this type of event.  
The EU is in  ‘an era of permacrisis and polycrisis ’ (
8). It has experienced numerous crises over 
a short amount of time, including the COVID -19 pandemic, the growing impact of climate 
change and Russia’ s war of aggression against Ukraine. The unprecedented scale of these 
crises threatens the functioning of society and requires a ‘ rapid response despite the great 
uncertainty regarding their potential evolution and the effectivene ss of available 
countermeasures ’ (9). The EU ’s role in crisis management has expanded, from facilitating 
coordination and solidarity between MS to providing rapid, flexible and cross -sectoral 
responses  (10). The EU ’s added value is  ‘higher in transboundar y crises and incidents that can 
overwhelm the response capabilities of individual MS ’ (11). As recently mentioned by the

 10 Commission ’s Scientific Advice Mechanism, European crisis management governance still 
needs strengthening by fostering synergies between EUIBAs and with MS  (12). 
Cybersecurity has become an integral part of European security  (13). The increasing 
dependence on information technology and the societies ’ growing interconnection has 
increased vulnerability surfaces, in particular to cyber threats. The World Economic Forum 
considers cross -border cyberattacks as an area where risk mitigation is still in the early stages 
of development  (14). ENISA’ s Threat Landscape 2022 report shows that cybersecurity attacks 
have continued to increase, in terms of vectors, number and impact  (15). Incidents due to human 
errors should not be underestimated, as they too can lead to major disruption.  
Cyber  crises  can affect  the proper  functioning of the internal  market  and public  security  in 
several  MS or the EU as a whole  (16). The EU has worked  to develop a dedicated crisis  
management  framework,  first with the Blueprint  (17) and with key texts  such  as NIS, the 
Cybersecurity  Act and NIS2 . The objectives  of the latter  on cyber  crisis  management  include:  
• increasing the capabilities and preparedness of MS to respond to cyber crises ; 
• improving cooperation, including information sharing and coordination  between MS and 
EUIBAs to deal with cyber crises ; 
• strengthening the EU ’s capacity to complement MS action in managing cyber crises.  
NIS2  requires  MS to develop  the structures,  entities  and procedures  needed specifically  for 
cyber  crisis management.  It formalises  EU-CyCLONe,  launched informally  in 2020,  to improve 
cooperation among  MS at the operational  level,  which  is understood as the intermediary  
between  the technical  level and the strategic  level.  
ENISA’s strengthened role in cyber  crisis  management  in the EU includes  the provision  of the 
secretariat  for EU-CyCLONe,  and support  the secure exchange  of information as well as 
provide necessary  tools  to support  cooperation between  MS. 
 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY  
This study aims to:  
• update EN ISA’s cyber crisis management knowledge base (18); 
• clarify the complexities and nuances of the notion of cyber crisis ; 
• provide an overview of the framework for cyber crisis management at the operational level in 
the EU, including the identification of key actors, highlighting their role and obligations;  
• identify best practices for cyber crisis management at operational level in the EU.  
The study is aimed at all cybersecurity stakeholders keen to improve both their understanding of and capabilities and procedures to manage cyber crises at the operational level.

 SCOPE OF THE STUDY 
This study  covers  recent  evolutions  in cyber  crisis  management  at the operational  level in the EU. 
It focuses  on the following  elements.  
• The transposition of NIS2 into national legislation, especially Article 9 , which is  dedicated to 
national cyber crisis management frameworks . 
• The operational level, the meaning of which may vary among  MS. In this study, the 
operational level is understood as the cornerstone for facilitating coordination and 
understanding between the strategic and technical levels.  
• Best practices and lessons learned from MS, along with  key challenges, to adequately 
prevent, detect, respond to or recover from cyber crises at the operational level.  ‘Best 
practices’  will be defined as  ‘activities that have been shown through research and 
evaluation to be effective, efficient, sustainable and/or transferable, and to reliably lead to a 
desired result ’ (19). These best practices have been proven at the national level  or within the 
national cyber crisis management authority.  
 METHODOLOGY  
This following methodology  was used to identify  best practices  in cyber  crisis  management  at the 
operational  level in the EU. 
Task 1: Data  collection  
• A research plan was elaborated to identify relevant open sources for data collection.  
• Deep-dive desk research was conducted to collect data on cyber crisis management in the 
EU. Sources are available in Section 7 ‘ Sources ’. 
Task 2: Expert  consultation  
• An expert consultation was designed to complement open-source information on best 
practices in cyber crisis management, to gather feedback from EU -CyCLONe members.  
• A workshop, including a presentation and discussion of identified best practices for cyber 
crisis management, and complementary interviews were conducted to enrich the study ’s 
conclusions.  
• Individual interviews were conducted with a select number of EU -CyCLONe members.  
Task 3: Drafting  of deliverables  
• Data was analysed, conclusions were drawn and drafts of the study were submitted to and 
reviewed by ENISA in an iterative fashion.  
• The final report was submitted to EU -CyCLONe members for review.

 12 2. DEFINITIONS FOR CYBER 
CRISIS MANAGEMENT AT THE 
OPERATIONAL LEVEL IN THE EU 
This section sets out to define the term ‘ cyber   crisis ’. It provides a brief definition of the notion of 
crisis in general, and the factors that shape a crisis. It examines the difference between a 
cybersecurity incident, a large- scale incident and a cyber crisis. It then turns to the management 
of cyber crises, beginning with a brief definition of crisis management, exploring the different levels at which a cyber crisis can be managed. It describes the capabilities and measures 
needed to manage cyber crises at the operational level in the EU, looking at the al l-hazards 
approach and the four stages of the cyber crisis management cycle.  
 DEFINING A CYBER CRISIS  
There are several definitions of a crisis. According to ISO 22361, a crisis is an ‘ abnormal or 
extraordinary event or situation which threatens an organisation or community and requires a strategic, adaptive and timely response in order to preserve its viability and integrity ’ (
20). It can 
also broadly be defined a s ‘an extraordinary event that differs from the normal and involves 
serious disturbance or risk for disturbance of vital societal functions ’ (21). A more granular 
definition of a crisis is ‘ a serious threat to the basic structures or the fundamental values and 
norms of a system, which, under time pressure and highly uncertain circ umstances, necessitate 
making vital decisions ’ (22). Defined more comprehensively, a crisis is  ‘an event that affects 
many people and large parts of society and threatens fundamental values and functions. Crisis 
is a condition that cannot be handled with ordinary resources and organisation. A crisis is 
unexpected, far removed from the ordinary and mundane. Resolving the crisis requires 
coordinated action from several players/actors ’ (23). Factors of uncertainty, risk and potential 
for severe consequences  are essential in qualifying and measuring the severity of a crisis, in 
addition to time sensitivity and the transboundary element of crises.  
The time sensitivity factor  is important to understand the nature of a crisis. Three types of 
crisis can be distinguished:  
• a creeping crisis, or hidden latent crisis, which simmers under the radar of the authorities, 
before suddenly and unexpectedly erupting;  
• an acute crisis, which is sudden, unforeseen and can have a massive impact in a very short 
amount of time;  
• a recurring crisis , which occurs on a regular basis as part of a cycle.

 13 The time factor is essential for responding to crises appropriately, effectively and quickly.  For 
example, because a creeping crisis occurs over a longer period of time, there is in theory more 
room for crisis prevention measures. An acute crisis, on the other hand, occurs over a very 
short period of time, meaning priority should be given to crisi s mitigation measures.  
Another factor that helps better define a crisis is its transboundary and cross -sectoral impact. A 
transboundary crisis can be understood as crossing geographical, organisational and/or political borders. ENISA ’s work for EU -CyCLONe found that a transboundary crisis could simply be 
characterised by its tendency to escalate rapidly, transform, proliferate across multiple jurisdictions and (national) borders, affecting various sectors, policy areas and critical 
infrastructures, strainin g and even exceeding the capacity of national crisis management 
systems.  
Transborder crises can have different scopes and simultaneously affect several territories, 
jurisdictions and/or sectors, and pose major challenges for decision-makers, who must 
cooperate beyond their national structures to respond effectively  (
24). Because factors of scope 
and time sensitivity are not mutually exclusive,  a crisis can be both transboundary and 
acute, transboundary and creeping, or transboundary and recurrent.  
As such, the notion of a cyber crisis can be complex to define . This is largely due to the 
differences among MS in definitions of the thresholds whic h make a cybersecurity incident a 
crisis.  
A cybersecurity incident  refers to  ‘an event compromising the availability, authenticity, 
integrity or confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or of the services offered by, 
or accessible via, netw ork and information systems ’ (25). To complement this definition, NIS2 
specifies that an incident is considered significant when it has  ‘caused or is capable of causing 
severe operational disruption of services or financial loss for the entity concerned’ and ‘has 
affected or is capable of affecting other natural or legal persons by causing considerable material or non-material damage’ (
26). 
A cyber incident becomes a large -scale cybersecurity incident  when it  ‘causes a level of 
disruption that exceeds a MS capacity to respond to it or which has a significant impact on at least two MS ’ (
27). A cyber incident therefore moves to ‘ large- scale ’ status if a MS is unable to 
take mitigating action on its own, or if more than two MS are affected.  
A large -scale cybersecurity incident can further escalate into a cyber crisis . As explained, the 
term is subject to varying definitions in MS, depending largely on the severity of the incident 
according to the MS  and the risk appetite. At the EU level, the notion of cyber crisis has often 
been defined with direct reference to the notion of (large- scale) cyber incident  since such  a 
crisis  is directly caused by a cybersecurity incident.  The scope, impact  and frequency  of the 
cyber event enables the evaluation of its severity, which is essential to escalate to the level of 
crisis. Ultimately, the transition to crisis status depends largely on a political decision to treat a 
large- scale cyber security incident as a crisis or not. This contributes to the complexity of 
defining a cyber crisis.

 14 The notion of cyber crisis is based on a number of EU cyber regulations and policies. NIS2 
indicates that depending on their cause and impact, a large- scale cybersecurity incident  ‘may 
escalate and turn into fully -fledged crisis  not allowing the proper functioning of the internal 
market or posing serious public security and safety risks for entities or citizens in several MS or 
the EU as a whole’ (28). Previously, the Blueprint (2017) had attempted to give a definition of 
‘cyber crisis’ by differentiating it from a cybersecurity incident, stating that  ‘a cybersecurity 
incident [could] be considered a crisis at Union level when the disruption caused by the incident 
[was] too extensive for a concerned MS to handle on its own or when it [affected] two or more 
MS with such a wide-ranging impact of technical or political significance that it [required] timely 
coordination and response at Union political level ’ (29). In addition to this transboundary 
dimension, a cyber crisis can be characterised by an abnormal and unstable situation that threatens an entity ’s strategic objectives, its reputation or its viability. The ENISA Report on 
Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management  (2014) further indicates that a cyber crisis is an 
event that strikes at the heart of an entity and that can have an impact beyond the entity 
itself (
30). 
Figure  1: Distinguishing between cyber incident, large-scale cyber incident and cyber 
crisis  (31) (32) 
 
It is thus difficult to find a common definition of the concept of cyber crisis shared by all MS and 
the EU. Within MS, the escalation from cyber incident to lar ge-scale cyber incident and finally to 
fully-fledged crisis depends largely on the risk appetite of each MS. Rather than relying on facts 
alone, declaring a cyber crisis as such at the MS level is above all a political decision linked to

 15 the risk appetite of the MS. The R eport on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management  
shows that escalation to the status of crisis is largely subjective, with political and 
organisational perceptions and c onstraints ‘creating’ the crisis. Here, crisis exists as an 
interpretation of the situation rather than as an absolute truth. As a result, what one actor perceives as a crisis may be perceived as daily routine by another, giving a degree of 
subjectivity to the escalation to crisis status  (
33). The escalation to crisis status depends on 
a MS’ risk appetite; beyond a certain threshold of tolerance, the incident can no longer be 
managed with the usual means:  it is then declared, and thus becomes, a crisis.  
Meanwhile, at the EU level, all MS must agree to move to crisis level based on agreed 
standard operating procedures (SOPs).   
A cyber crisis and its severity can be assessed by looking at different factors which include 
the causes , nature  and impact . Such an assessment is essential , as it should lead to the 
adoption of appropriate cyber crisis management measures.  
The causes of a cyber crisis  can be multiple and both physical and non-physical. Non-
physical causes include targeted action by malicious actors, such as a cyberattack, which may escalate into a crisis. Human errors, malfunctions and malicious actions can also 
disrupt th e functioning of network s and IS and result in a cyber crisis. Causes can also be 
found in the physical environment  (
34). As highlighted by NIS2, theft, fire, flood, 
telecommunications or power failure, unauthorised physical access or damage can all 
compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data stored, 
transmitted or processed or services offered by or accessible through networks and IS  (35). 
Consequently, the  hybrid nature of the cyber domain poses particular challenges to 
determining the origins of a cyber crisis, as it combines a ‘ mixture of conventional and 
unconventional, military and non-military, overt and covert actions that can be used in a coordinated manner by state or non- state actors to achieve specific objectives while 
remaining below the threshold of formally declared warfare’ (
36). This hybrid nature can act 
as a brake to the escalation of a cyber incident into a crisis, due to the potentially political 
connotations of the term and the difficulty of assessing both the physical and non-physical 
origins of the crisis.  
A cyber crisis can be considered as transborder . Cyberspace is made up of physical 
assets scattered across different countries, but which remain (inter)dependent  (37). It knows 
no geographical boundaries, meaning that a cyber crisis has a serious potential to spread 
acros s several entities, jurisdictions or territories. In addition, every sector now has a cyber 
element, which can lead to a cyber crisis spreading beyond a specific sector. For example, a cyber crisis originating in the energy sector could very well affect the transport sector via 
its IS . ENISA’ s work for EU -CyCLONe found that  EU cyber crises could be considered 
as potentially  transborder by definition, as they  transcend traditional political, 
functional and sectoral boundaries within and between MS  (
38) (39). 
The impact  of a cyber incident is a determining factor in the escalation to a large-scale 
cybersecurity incident or a crisis. Impact can be defined by the number of entities affected, 
whether a number of individuals, companies/organisations, sectors or MS. The type of

(34) Physical damage can have repercussions in the virtual world: for example, a flood or fire can disrupt servers, causing a cyber 
incident that can turn into a crisis. One such example of a cyber incident  caused by physical damage occurred in France in 
March 2021, when a fire broke out in a data centre, causing major disruptions on the servers.

cooperation at the  
EU level, a creeping crisis?  
In May 2017, the 
WannaCry ransomware 
rapidly spread to more 
than 230 000 computers 
in 150 countries, encrypting files on the 
hard drives of Windows 
systems, preventing users 
from accessing them and demanding a ransom to 
decrypt the files. It was a 
cross -sector propagation 
that affected several 
users in several countries, 
impacting thousands of 
operating systems  (
35). 
WannaCry was 
considered a large-scale 
cyber  security incident 
and was not elevated to 
the status of a crisis . At 
the time, only the technical level of cyber 
crisis management was in 
place.  
WannaCry could be 
considered a large-scale creeping cybersecurity 
incident  because the 
cyberthreat was hidden in plain sight, evolving 
gradually over time on computers around the 
world in a non-linear 
pattern  (

 16 entities affected and whether they  operate services considered vital to the functioning of the 
nation is crucial. Particular attention is therefore paid to services and activities defined by NIS2 
as essential  (energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructure, health, drinking wa ter, 
waste water, digital infrastructure, ICT service management, public administration and space) and important  (postal and courier services, waste management, manufacturing, chemicals, 
production, food, manufacturing, digital suppliers  and research)  (
40). If these services are 
affected, the incident is likely to reach crisis level, given the potential to disrupt vital services.  
There are therefore different types of cyber crisis, with different degrees of complexity. This 
diversity, together with the varying capabilities of each MS to combat cyber crises, influences 
their classification of a cyber incident as a crisis. The lack of common indicators for defining a 
‘cyber crisis’ at the EU level makes it both complex and sensitive to escalate a large-scale 
cybersecurity incident into a full -fledged crisis.  
 DEFINING CYBER  CRISIS  MANAGEMENT  
This study builds on previous work by ENISA, which defines crisis management as  ‘an 
institutional and organisational design process ’ (41), a ‘[ broad] structure [that] encompasses 
decision-makers [with specific roles and actions ]’ (42). In general terms, crisis management is 
understood as  ‘making and effecting difficult decisions under difficult circumstances ’ (43). 
The EU ’s crisis management competences have grown significantly  in sectors such as civil 
protection, terrorism, health, the environment, critical infrastructures and cybercrime (44). While 
national security remains the prerogative of MS , the EU plays a growing  role in 
coordinating and improving cooperation between MS in the event of a crisis. The EU has developed the capacity to support MS overwhelmed by a disaster or crisis, to manage 
transboundary crises and to provide assistance in the event of a crisis outside the EU  (
45). 
Crisis management at the EU level involves a highly complex and interwoven system of 
actors, structures and processes operating at many levels.  
Cyber crisis management is part of a wider crisis management framework.  While some 
consider that every type of existing crisis has a cyber element, others argue that cyber crisis 
management should be seen as a stand-alone practice. These approaches are not mutually 
exclusive and could even be more effective when combined . Cyber crisis management can 
be understood as the management of a crisis which has a cyber origin or a significant cyber component.  
At the EU level, both approaches exist for cyber crisis management . Cyber crisis 
management in the EU is handled by different EU institutions and agencies , depending on the 
type of crisis encountered.  The EU’s high- level (or generic) crisis management mechanisms can 
be used and applied in the context of cyber crises specifically, but are not limited to them. This is the case, f or example, of the Council’ s Integrated Policy Response Capability (IPCR) 
Mechanism, the European Commission ’s ARGUS system or the European External Action 
Service’s ( EEAS) Crisis Response Mechanism (CRM)  (
46) (47). Overall, the cross-sectoral 
nature of crises means that multiple actors from different  sectors must cooperate and

 17 share information, and the transboundary nature of cyber crises is a perfect 
illustration (48). 
The EU has long been working on a specific legislative framework for cyber crisis 
management . The aim is for MS to comply with minimum requirements for cybersecurity 
resilience, which includes improving cyber crisis management capabilities. Three major pie ces 
of legislation have structured the development of cybersecurity crisis management, namely NIS, 
the Cybersecurity Act and, most recently, NIS2 (49). In particular, NIS2 introduces new rules to 
improve the way the EU prevents, manages and responds to large- scale cyber security 
incidents and crises by establishing clear responsibilities, proper planning and better 
cooperation within the EU  (50). However , even with the development of measures 
specifically designed for cyber crisis management, the latter remains embedded in the policies and plans of broader crisis management structures, both at the national and EU 
level s. 
The management of a cyber crisis i nvolves public and private stakeholders from the civilian , 
law enforcement  and defence sectors,  depending on the nature and impact of the cyber 
crisis . These actors operate at different levels . 
• Organisational and corporate level . Critical entities affected by a cyber crisis are key 
players in managing cyber crises. Their cooperation and information are essential to ensure that situational awareness is shared in a timely manner and that mitigation measures are 
properly implemented.  They also play a crucial role in crisis prevention, for example by 
communicating the mapping of their ISs to the national authorities responsible for crisis 
management, and must be supported to increase their resilience to cyber crises.  
• Sectoral level . Crisis management can also follow a sectoral approach, incorporating a cyber 
element for each sector considered critical. This can be envisaged for better coordination 
and cooperation between actors, providing a cyber crisis management plan tailored to each 
sector. In this case, NIS2 can serve as a basis since it defines the entities in the sectors 
considered ‘essential ’ and ‘important ’ (
51) because they provide vital services to the nation.  
• Regional level . Within MS, regional authorities can be involved in managing cyber crises, 
among others , because of their proximity to the entities affected in the event of a crisis.  
• National level . MS have primary responsibility for cybersecurity, for crisis management, and 
for the management of cyber crises. Consequently, MS must take the necessary measures 
to ensure the protection of essential national security interests and to safeguard public 
order and public security  (52). While cyber crisis management can be a politically sensitive 
issue and remains a national competence, MS often choose to work together through 
coordination mechanisms and networks, with varying degrees of formalisation (53). NIS2 
now requires MS to draw up a cyber crisis management plan and set up national crisis management authorities.  
• EU level . NIS2 ’s definition of a cyber crisis implies that the affected MS is either unable to 
respond to the situation alone, or that the crisis affects at least one other MS. The EU plays 
an essential role in preventing and mitigating cyber crises, in particular by establishing 
common benchmarks which contribute to raising the European level of resilience to cyber 
crises and by strengthenin g MS crisis management capabilities and improving collective 
situational awareness  (
54).

 18 • International level . Cyber crises can go beyond the borders of MS and involve non -EU 
countries, requiring international intervention to resolve the situation. Bilateral agreements 
can be concluded between MS and non -EU countries directly, or between the EU and non -
EU countries or other regional organisations worldwide. The cyber diplomacy toolbox, for 
example, was created to provide ‘ an appropriate framework for a common EU diplomatic 
response to malicious cyber activities in order to mitigate and/or deter potential cyber attackers from harming the political, security and economic interests of the European 
Union’ (
55), beyond the EU’ s borders.  
Different actors from different sectors and levels can be involved in the management of cyber 
crises. This study focuses specifically on the EU level . 
In the event of a cyber crisis, MS and the relevant EUIBAs must cooperate ‘ to properly 
coordinate the response across the EU ’ (56) at three different levels : the strategic, operational 
and technical levels  (57). 
• The strategic level is responsible for the strategic and political management of both the cyber 
and non-cyber aspects of a crisis. Actors include MS ministers responsible for 
cybersecurity, the European Council  and its President , the Presidency of the Council of the 
European Union and the Council of the E uropean Union, the European Commission, 
including the President or the delegated Vice-President/Commissioner and the EEAS, 
including the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy  (58). 
• The operational level focuses on preparing decision -making at the strategic level, 
coordinating cyber cris is management, a nd situational awareness, impact 
assessment and mitigation measures.  It should be noted that the definition of the 
‘operational ’ level may vary from one MS to another, in some cases corresponding to the 
technical level. In this publication, the operational level is defined as the cornerstone for 
strengthening cooperation between the various MS and EU institutions , and for 
facilitat ing coordination between the strategic and technical levels.  EU-CyCLONe 
was established precisely to fill this gap (59). 
• The technical level  involves incident handling during a cyber crisis and incident monitoring 
and surveillance, including continuous analysis of threats and risks. Actors include the 
CSIRTs Network, national CSIRTs, the European Commission, EEAS, the Computer 
Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, ENISA and the 
European Cybercrime Centre  of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement 
Cooperation  (60).

Managing a cyber crisis involves a significant number of actors.  As ENISA’ s 2016 
Strategies for incident response and cyber crisis cooperation report points out,  ‘the key in 
effective cyber crisis coordination is the shared responsibility and comprehensive 
approach among the stakeholders’  (64). In the EU, the question of who is responsible largely 
depends on the level(s) at which the cyber crisis occurs. This study however focuses on the operational level , as do the best practices identified in the next chapter.  
A variety of capabilities and measures can be put in place to manage cyber crises. These need 
to be organised in a comprehensive way  to ensure successful cyber crisis management. 
Indeed, in the cyber domain, crisis management involves  ‘capabilities to adequately prevent,

 20 detect, respond to, recover from or mitigate the impact of incidents ’ (65). Since threats can have 
different origins, management measures should be based on an all -hazards approach . This 
approach aims  ‘to protect network s, ISs and the physical environment of those systems from 
events such as theft, fire, flood, telecommunication or power failures, or unauthorised physical 
access and damage which could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity or 
confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or of the services offered by, or 
accessible via, network and information systems ’ (66). The all-hazards approach offers a 
comprehensive approach to cyber crisis management, taking into account the m ultiple potential 
causes of cyber crises, which can originate in both the physical and non-physical worlds.  
Taking into account the origins of cyber crises is important to shaping the adequate response, 
but it is equally important to integrate certain key steps in the development of an effective and 
coherent cyber crisis management strategy. T he ENISA Report on Cyber Crisis Management 
and Cooperation  (2014) highlights five key tasks to conduct crisis management in order to 
resolve any kind of crisis situation. These tasks overlap and flow into each other and include:  
• sense- making , which involves finding out what is happening and why ; 
• meaning -making , which involves conveying an understanding of the situation to others so 
that they understand why it is a crisis and why certain actions must be taken; 
• decision -making , which involves taking action to resolve the situation using available 
resources, taking i nto account logistical, time, legal and democratic constraints, ensuring 
that the objectives of resolving the crisis are achieved at all levels, from strategic to 
operational and technical; 
• termination , with decision -makers deciding that the crisis is over  and that the crisis 
management organisation can be dissolved; t he situation at this point may not have 
completely returned to normal, but what remains can be managed using non- crisis 
measures ; 
• learning and reform , with investigations and potential changes in policies and practices, a 
crucial step which offers an opportunity to improve and correct the flaws in the system revealed by the crisis.  
These five tasks form the basis for the management of any type of crisis,  as they enable 
crucial questions to be tackled by authorities responsible for crisis management. Each task 
brings its own challenges for the organisation of crisis management and can be used to guide 
the design of crisis management operations  (
67). With regards to cyber crisis management 
specifically, the ENISA Report on Cyber Crisis Management and Cooperation  (2014) proposes 
using the challenges associated with the five tasks as an analytical roadmap to guide the 
development of cyber crisis management operations  (68). These challenges are summarised in 
Figure  2.

(68) Ibid. Best Practices for C yber Crisis Management  
February 2024 
 
 
 21 Figure  2: Cyber crisis management challenges (69) 
 
These challenges should be taken into consideration when designing comprehensive 
cyber crisis management measures . The tasks and challenges can then be used to develop 
and improve best practices at each phase of the cyber crisis management cycle, namely prevention, preparedness, response and recovery (
70). All these phases can include several 
of the tasks depicted in Figure  2 (sense- making, meaning- making, decision -making, termination, 
learning).  
The four phases are detailed below  (71). 
• Phase 1 – Prevention.  This aims to better prevent and reduce the risk of cyber crises 
occurring and to anticipate and minimise  their potential  effects should they arise. Preventive 
measures are taken before a crisis occurs, but also afterwards as they allow lessons to be 
learned for  the management of future crises.  
• Phase 2 – Preparedness.  This aims to improve the management of crises by developing 
plans to support response operations. This includes activities such as setting up a resilient 
crisis organisation, maintaining the confidence of the ecosystem, prioritising the critical 
activities affected or ensuring that responders know how to act by undergoing training and 
exercises. Preparedness measures are taken before a crisis occurs.  
• Phase 3 – Response . This aims to stem the cyber crisis and prevent further damage. At the 
EU level, response is based on effective technical, operational and strategic cooperation 
between MS and EUIBA s. An effective and safe response involves activating 
predetermined measures. These measures are taken during crises.  
• Phase 4 – Recovery.  This aims to enable quick recovery by taking measures when a crisis is 
over or its end is in sight to return to a level of security and activity that is normal or even higher than before the crisis. Thi s phase covers restoration of affected systems and 
arrangements or organising lessons learned to better prevent, respond to and mitigate future crises. Such measures are taken after crises occur.

 22 These four phases should always be taken into account for effective management of 
cyber crises, along with the all-hazard approach , to provide a comprehensive approach  
to cyber crisis managemen t. 
Key takeaways  
• The notion of a cyber crisis is complex, not least because it leaves room for a degree of 
subjectivity: a cyber incident may be considered as a crisis in one MS but not necessarily in another. While a given MS may be unable to respond to the situation and therefore require the 
activation of exceptional measures, another may well have the capacity to manage the incident 
without having to elevate it to crisis status. Risk assessment is therefore inextricably linked to the notion of cyber crisis and depends largely on the level of risk that each MS is prepared to 
tolerate.  
 
• At the EU level, this brings about numerous challenges. The development of clear indicators 
or decision mechanisms  for escalation to crisis status at the EU level, taking into 
consideration both national capabilities and priorities, could help alleviate some of those 
challenges.  
 
• The causes , nature  and impact  of a cyber crisis can support the assessment of the crisis and 
its severity and influence the selection and adoption of appropriate measures for cyber crisis management.  
 
• With NIS2, MS have to develop a specific framework for cyber crisis management . However, 
because cyber crises tend to have a transboundary  nature, any cyber crisis management 
framework must remain part of overarching crisis management for overall coherence.  
 
• The management of a cyber crisis involves a variety of actors at the  
organisation /company , sectoral , regional , national  and EU levels . It is managed at the 
strategic , operational  and technical  levels , with the operational level playing  a key role in 
bridging the gap between the other two levels, ensuring information is shared across all levels, greater cooperation and coordination between all relevant stakeholders.  
 
• Cyber crisis management should take into account the four phases of the  cyber crisis 
management cycle, i.e. prevention, preparedness , response and recovery.  These four 
phases should be framed by an all-hazard approach , since threats can have many different 
origins.  Best Practices for C yber Crisis Management

 23 3. STRUCTURE AND ACTORS 
OF CYBER CRISIS 
MANAGEMENT AT THE 
OPERATIONAL LEVEL IN THE EU 
This section gives an overview of t he EU ’s complex cybersecurity ecosystem of actors, 
structures and mechanisms. It first outlines the structure of cyber crisis management at the 
operational level in the EU, then describes the roles and obligations of the main EU actors in 
cyber crisis management  at the operational level, namely ENISA, MS  and EU-CyCLONe.  
 OVERVIEW OF THE STRUCTURE OF CYBER CRISIS MANAGEMENT  
AT THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL IN THE EU  
Due to the transboundary nature of cyber crises, a vast network of public actors participates in their management across the EU, leading to a highly complex and overlapping system of actors, 
structures and processes operating within the cyber domain. In th is context, NIS2 aims to bring 
about a more coordinated approach through greater cooperation between MS and relevant 
EUIBAs at the technical, operational and strategic levels  (
72). 
Several EUIBAs are involved in cyber crisis management at all levels.  These include the 
European Commission and the EEAS, whose work is mainly at the strategic level.  The 
Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions  (CERT -EU), bodies and agencies 
is a CSIRTs Network member and is responsible for EUIBAs.  The European Union Agency for 
Law Enforcement Cooperation is responsible for the fight against cybercrime through  its 
European Cybercrime Centre, through the Law Enforcement Emergency Response Protocol 
and within the Joint Cyberspace Action Task Force.  
EU organisations responsible specifically for cyber crisis management at the strategic, 
operational, technical levels include,  for instance:  
• at the strategic level, the Horizontal Working Party on Cyber Issues or the Committee of 
Permanent Representatives ; 
• at the operational level, EU -CyCLONe  (73); 
• at the technical level, the CSIRTs Network.  
A lot has changed for cyber crisis management in the EU since ENISA’ s report on EU common 
crisis management practices and their applicability to cyber crises (2015). At the time, the EU 
did not yet have its own legislative and operational framework dedicated to cyber crisis 
management. Instead, it relied on several crisis management mechanisms,  which follow the 
guiding principle of complementarity and continue to apply today to cyber crises . 
 
(72) See footnote (13), recital  69. 
(73) See Chapter  3.4 ‘Role and obligations of the European Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (EU -CyCLONe) in cyber crisis 
management at the operational level in the EU ’. Best Practices for C yber Crisis Management

 24 • The Council ’s IPCR , to coordinate the policy response to cross -sectoral crises and cyber 
crises. It can be activated by institutional cybersecurity actors in the event of an EU -wide 
crisis with a cybersecurity dimension.  
• The European Commission ’s ARGUS system,  an internal early warning communication 
system which provides a specific coordination process that can be activated in the event of 
a multi -sector crisis.  
• The EEAS CRM , to provide a coordinated and synergistic response to crises and 
emergencies of an external nature or with an external dimension. It can be activated if a 
cyber crisis has a Common Foreign and Security Policy or Common Defence Policy 
dimension, for example  impacting EU or MS national security interests.  
The EU has since worked to develop an appropriate crisis management framework specifically 
for cybersecurity. While continuing to build on broader existing crisis management frameworks 
and integrate new initiatives, the EU now has  specific cybersecurity legislation . This includes 
the Cybersecurity Act  and the NIS directives,  which shaped European cybersecurity by 
introducing obligations and relevant sanctions, introducing mechanisms to better manage cyber 
crises in the EU and strengthening ENISA ’s role and capabilities in this field.  
 ROLE AND OBLIGATIONS OF ENISA IN CYBER CRISIS 
MANAGEMENT AT THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL IN THE EU 
The Cybersecurity Act and NIS2 have significantly strengthened ENISA’ s mandate. One of the 
agency ’s strategic objectives, reaffirmed by the Agency Single Programming Document 2023 –
2025, is to enable effective cooperation amongst operational actors within the EU in case of large- scale cyber incidents, in particular  by developing tools and methodologies for 
effective cyber crisis management  (
74). Among other things, ENISA serves as an information 
hub, enabling all actors involved at the EU level to collaborate and respond to large- scale cyber 
incidents and crises by  (75): 
• enhancing and improving incident response capabilities and readiness across the EU through 
the CSIRT Network ; 
• enabling effective European cybersecurity crisis management at the operational level via EU -
CyCLONe  (76); 
• ensuring coordination in cybersecurity crisis management among relevant EUIBAs ; 
• improving the maturity and capabilities of operational communities (CSIRT Network, EU -
CyCLONe and EUIBAs) including cooperation with law enforcement authorities ; 
• contributing to preparedness, sharing situational awareness, coordinating response and 
recovery from large-scale cyber incidents and crises in different communities ; 
• supporting the evolution of an EU joint response by enabling the deployment of EU -level 
proposals.  
NIS2 provides ENISA with new tasks,  including  (77): 
• developing and maintaining a European vulnerability registry ; 
• providing the Secretariat of EU -CyCLONE ; 
• publishing an annual report on the state of cybersecurity in the EU ; 
• supporting the organisation of peer reviews between MS ;

 25 • creating and maintaining a registry for entities providing cross -border services (DNS service 
providers, TLD name registries, entities providing domain name registration services, cloud 
computing service providers and data centre providers).  
NIS2 makes ENISA responsible for supporting the coordination of  cyber crises in the EU by 
advising and assisting EU -CyCLONe, which supports the coordinated management of large-
scale cybersecurity incidents and crises at the operational level (78). The agenc y provides EU -
CyCLONe with a s ecretariat, but also with the infrastructure and tools necessary to ensure 
effective cooperation among MS  (79). ENISA therefore contributes to improved sharing of 
situational awareness at the operational level across the EU, thereby enhancing the 
management of large- scale cyber incidents and crises in the EU.  
Finally, ENISA plays a key role in implementing the NIS directives by providing assistance 
to the MS on its transposition, for instance with Article 9 of NIS2  on national cyber crisis 
management frameworks, and by organising exercises.  
 ROLE AND OBLIGATIONS OF MS AND COOPERATION MECHANISMS 
FOR CYBER CRISIS MANAGEMENT AT T HE OPERATIONAL LEVEL IN 
THE EU 
MS cyber crisis management procedures are integrated into their own general national crisis 
management frameworks  (80). A variety of actors are therefore in charge of cyber crisis 
management at the operational level within MS . They are responsible for liaising between 
the strategic level, often represented by the national crisis management structure, and the technical level, embodied by the appointed CSIRTs Network member  (
81). 
These actors include ‘National cybersecurity authorities’  (the exact terminology varies from 
one MS to another), which tend to be the government agency responsible for cybersecurity, and to be in the lead for national cybersecurity efforts at the technical, operational and sometimes 
strategic levels . These authorities are represented in EU -CyCLONe in cyber crisis management 
at the operational level in the EU by EU-CyCLONe Executives,  i.e. heads of n ational 
cybersecurity authorities and EU-CyCLONe Officers , i.e. experts in crisis management and/or 
international relations supporting the decision- makers, prior to and during large- scale incident or 
crisis situations  (
82). 
The majority of MS rely on a comprehensive national crisis management structure which can be deployed regardless of the origin or nature of the crisis, including cyber. A few MS have 
developed specific frameworks and structures for cyber crisis management. A high degree of 
centralisation of cyber crisis management is beneficial in terms of speed and efficiency of 
decision-making and access to information, but can exclude important stakeholders and 
overburden certain institutions. Conversely, a decentralised approach is likely t o offer flexibility 
and the ability to adapt to changing needs, but has the disadvantage of hampering government -
wide coordination efforts  (
83). 
Much of the current work to improve the management of cyber crises at the EU level has 
focused on helping MS to build up their capabilities  in this area, preventing crises and 
preparing MS to deal with them should they arise. NIS2 impacts the organisation of cyber

 26 crisis management within MS, as it dictates the development of National cyber crisis 
management frameworks . 
In this respect, Article  9 of NIS2  extends the obligations of MS in the management of cyber 
crises. By 2024, MS will have to (84): 
• designate or establish one or more cyber crisis management authorities competent for the 
management of large- scale cybersecurity and crises ; 
• equip such cyber c risis management authorities with the appropriate resources to carry out 
their mission in line with general national framework for crisis management ; 
• identify capabilities, assets and procedures to be deployed in case of a crisis ; 
• adopt a national large-sc ale cybersecurity incident and crisis response plan highlighting 
objectives and arrangements for the management of large-scale cybersecurity incidents and crises, including:  
• o bjectives of national preparedness measures and activities , 
• tasks and responsibil ities of cyber crisis management authorities , 
• cyber crisis management procedures, how they integrate into general national 
crisis management frameworks and channels for information exchange, 
• n ational preparedness measures (including exercises and training  programme s), 
• n ational procedures and agreements between the competent national authorities 
and bodies to ensure the effective participation and support of MS in the coordinated management of large-scale cybersecurity incidents and crises at the 
EU level.  
For cyber crisis management at the operational level, MS have benefited from EU-CyCLONe 
since 2020; this was formalised by NIS2 in January 2023.  
 ROLE AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE  EUROPEAN CYBER CRISIS 
LIAISON ORGANISATION NETWORK IN CYBER CRISIS MANAGEME NT 
AT THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL IN THE EU  
EU-CyCLONe acts as the key intermediary between the technical and strategic levels during large- scale cybersecurity incidents and crises. Launched in 2020 and formalised in 2023, it 
supports decision- making at the strategic level while improving cooperation  at the operational 
level through the regular exchange of information between MS  (
85). 
EU-CyCLONe plays a central role in the European cyber crisis management landscape,  
encompassing representations from both the MS and EUIBAs . It is composed of 
representatives of the cyber crisis management authorities of the MS and the European 
Commission, and its secretariat is provided by ENISA  (86). It is chaired by the MS holding the 
Presidency of the E uropean Union (87). 
Article  16 of NIS2 defines the tasks of EU -CyCLONE:  
• to increase the level of preparedness of the management of large- scale cybersecurity 
incidents and crises ; 
• to develop a shared situational awareness for large- scale cybersecurity incidents and crises ; 
• to assess the consequences and impact of relevant large- scale cybersecurity incidents and 
crises and propose possible mitigation measures ;

 27 • to coordinate the management of large- scale cybersecurity incidents and crises and support 
decision-making at political level in relation to such incidents and crises ; 
• to discuss, upon the request of a MS, national large- scale cybersecurity incident and crisis 
response plans referred to in A rticle  9(4) of NIS2.  
In short, EU -CyCLONe enables rapid cyber crisis management coordination in case of a large-
scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents or crises in the EU by providing timely information 
sharing and situational awareness among competent authorities. The group supports the 
cooperation among MS, in particular through the regular exchange of information between and 
among MS and EUIBAs  (88). 
 
  
 
(88) Ibid. Key takeaways  
• At the EU level, several EU institutions and EUIBAs  are involved in crisis 
management at the strategic, operational and technical levels,  and various crisis 
management mechanisms are available (IPCR, ARGUS, CRM). Thes e actors and 
mechanisms can be used for the management of cyber crises.  
 
• The EU has a complex cybersecurity ecosystem of actors, structures and 
mechanisms.  The transboundary nature of cyber crises means a vast network of 
public actors participate in crisis management across the EU, leading to a ‘highly 
complex and overlapping system of actors, structures and processes operating within 
the cyber domain’ .  
 
• The EU has developed a crisis management framework specifically dedicated to 
the management of cyber crises,  including through the Cybersecurity Act, NIS and 
particularly NIS2. This framework is part of broader existing crisis management frameworks, which include high -level mechanisms such as IPCR, ARGUS or CRM.  
 
• NIS2 (2022) aims to bring about a more coordinated approach through greater 
cooperation  between MS and relevant EU institutions and EUIBAs at all levels.  
 
• With regard to the operational level of cyber crisis management in the EU, NIS2 will have the following impacts:  
 
• an enhanced role for ENISA in cyber crisis management;  
• new obligations for MS, among which the development of specific cyber crisis 
management plans and the identification of a cyber  crisis management national 
authority;  
• positioning EU -CyCLONe as a key player for cyber crisis management at the 
operational level in the EU, supporting cooperation and coordination between 
actors and facilitating information exchange.  Best Practices for C yber Crisis Management

 28 4. CYBER  CRISIS  
MANAGEMENT  BEST  
PRACTICES  AT THE 
OPERATIONAL LEVEL IN THE 
EU 
This section presents 15 best practices in cyber crisis management at the operational level in 
the EU. Each of these best practices is in line with the provisions of NIS2, particularly Article  9 
‘National cyber crisis management frameworks ’ and Article  16 ‘European cyber crisis l iaison 
organisation network (EU -CyCLONe) ’. These best practices are all established, tested and 
approved in at least one M S or at the EU level, and have been the subject of public 
communication. Each best practice contains a concrete example of application by a MS, an 
analysis of its contribution to cyber crisis management at the operational level in the EU and of 
the way forward, and is linked to NIS2 objectives. T his structure provides food for thought to 
entities seeking to improve their cyber crisis management practices, including in the framework 
of the implementation of NIS2.  
The management of cyber crises can be broken down into different phases.  The Blueprint 
(2017) breaks down the crisis management lifecycle into four phases: prevention, 
preparedness, response and recovery  (89).

 29 The operational level of cyber crisis management is central to the first two phases of the 
cycle, i.e. prevention and preparedness, as it is particularly concerned with threat 
analysis, situation assessment and mitigation measures. It is directly relevant for the 
other two phases as the crucial interface between the strategic and technical levels.  
For the purposes of this study,  ‘best practices’  are understood as  ‘activities that have been 
shown through research and evaluation to be effective, efficient, sustainable and/or transferable, and to reliably lead to a desired result ’ (
90). 
 PHASE 1  – PREVENTION 
The prevention phase aims to support the EU and its MS to improve the prevent ion and reduce 
the risk of cyber crises occurring and anticipate ways to minimise their effects. Preventive 
measures include reinforcing protection and erecting barriers to prevent malicious actors from 
attacking an IT system, thereby avoiding a crisis. Preve ntive measures are taken before a crisis 
occurs, but also afterwards as a result of lessons learned from past crises.

BP #1 . Adoption of a national definition of ‘ cyber crisis ’, taking into account its 
transboundary dimension  
BP # 2. Development of information security standards specific to the national 
public sector, to be reviewed and updated regularly  
BP # 3. Foster national initiatives which promote the creation of prevention 
programmes such as centralised DDoS mitigation programmes  
 
Best practice #1: Adoption of a national definition of ‘ cyber crisis’, taking into account its 
transboundary dimension . 
• Example . Several MS define a ‘cyber crisis’ by the major impact on the operations of the 
organisations affected, the need for prompt decision-making and the ineffectiveness of 
usual incident handling proced ures. The Dutch definition focuses more closely on the 
geographical dimension. The Netherlands identifies eight basic elements which characterise a cyber crisis in its National Crisis Plan Digital (2022)  (
90F91). Most of these 
criteria refer to the transboundary nature of such a crisis: a ‘ technical failure inside or 
outside the Netherlands ’, an ‘involvement of a statewide or other actor ’, ‘cross -regional 
effects ’ (including physical ones), and  ‘effect of the cris is abroad’. All these elements 
suggest an international coordination effort to respond to the cyber crisis.  
• Analysis and way forward . The definition of ‘cyber crisis’ varies among MS. Most only 
consider the consequences on their territory, to the detriment of the cross -border effects. A 
joint understanding of the transboundary nature of this type of event could contribute to a clearer perception of the issues at stake and the resources to be put in place for more 
efficient management at the EU level. On the basis of NIS2, which points out that a cyber 
crisis could pose ‘ serious public security and safety risks for entities or citizens in several 
MS’, the homogenisation of national definitions highlighting the potentially foreign origin 
and/or consequences would facilitate better European coordination and cooperation. Such

 30 a definition could also include a list of detailed indicators or decision-making mechanisms 
that would serve as a roadmap on how to operate in a state of crisis. In this respect, EU -
CyCLONe could be used to gather input from MS to formulate such a list. However, such a definition should avoid imposing a one-size -fits-all solution and instead take into account 
the var ying capabilities and priorities of MS. EU -CyCLONe could work on developing a sort 
of ‘cybersecurity dictionary ’, gathering MS ’ definitions and their equivalents in each 
jurisdiction, to facilitate mutual understanding (
92). 
• Matching  NIS2 objective  
• Article  9.1. Each Member State shall designate or establish one or more competent 
authorities responsible for the management of large- scale cybersecurity incidents and 
crises (cyber crisis management authorities). Member States shall ensure that those authorities have adequate resources to carry out, in an effective and efficient manner, 
the tasks assigned to them. Member States shall ensure coherence with the existing 
frameworks for general national crisis management.  
Best practice # 2: Development of information security standards specific to the national 
public sector, to be reviewed and updated regularly.  
• Example s 
• Since 2004, Estonia has required its public administrations to adopt and comply with the ISKE (IT Baseline Security System) standard  (
93). ISKE is an information security 
standard developed specifically for the Estonian public sector, guaranteeing a 
sufficient level of security for data processed in IT systems. It is regularly updated 
and, from 31 December 2023, will be replaced by a new standard, the Estonian 
Information Security Standard (E -ITS). E-ITS will improve the information security of 
Estonian public authorities and private companies, and will be updated every 
autumn (94). 
• France’ s National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) developed 
a self -assessment tool for cyber crisis preparedness which enables entities to assess 
their level of preparedness for cyber crises (95). The tool allows users to share their 
anonymised data with ANSSI, enabling the agency to consolidate its understanding of 
the maturity levels of each sector in France, highlighting those which may require 
closer attention. Such a tool could be used to support national cyber crisis 
management authorities in the development of advanced mappings.  
• Analysis and way forward . The national cyber crisis authority is responsible for developing 
and implementing information security standards specifically designed for the national public 
sector. Organisations must comply with these standards, thus increasing their ability to 
prevent crises, improving their resilience. This facilitates cyber crisis management by lowering 
the risk of crises. They should be regularly reviewed and updated to account for evolving 
cyber threats and opportunities to strengthen national IS. This update could include, for 
instance, risk and compliance assessments to ensure that the standards remain relevant. The 
standards should guarantee a minimum level of cybersecurity and standardised system 
protection for public administrations, strengthening the barriers against malicious actors. This 
practice could be generalised at the EU level for all MS , to guarantee a common level of 
cybersecurity throughout the E U and better protect European public administrations through 
increased resilience. Regular updating of these standards would make it possible to assess 
the effectiveness of the measures and ensure that they take account of the changing nature of 
cyber threats.

 31 • Matching NIS2 objectives  
• Article  9.4.b.  Each Member State shall adopt a national large -scale cybersecurity 
incident and crisis response plan where the objectives of and arrangements for the 
management of large- scale cybersecurity incidents and crises are set out. That plan 
shall lay down, in particular: the tasks and responsibilities of  the cyber crisis 
management authorities.  
• Recital  57. As part of their national cybersecurity strategies, MS should adopt policies 
on the promotion of active cyber protection as part of a wider defensive strategy. 
Rather than responding reactively, active cyber protection is the prevention […] of 
network security breaches in an active manner, combined with the use of capabilities 
deployed within and outside the victim network.  
Best practice # 3: Foster national initiatives which promote the creation of prevention 
programmes , such as centralised DDoS mitigation programmes.  
• Example . In several MS, national actors have come together to launch nationwide threat and 
incident mitigation programmes. For example, the Artemis  (96) (Poland) and DNS 
Belgium  (97) (Belgium) initiatives were respectively designed to research the vulnerability of 
websites and domain names, alert others to these vulnerabilities and warn of potential 
consequences. For more large -scale incidents, such as DD oS attacks, the Netherlands has 
promoted the creation of the Dutch Anti-DDoS Coalition  (ADC) , of which the National Cyber 
Security Centr e is a member  (98). The 16 members of this national consortium are Dutch 
organisations from different sectors, including essential and important ones (government 
agencies, law enforcement, ISP s, banks, etc.). They work together to improve the resilience 
of Dutch critical service providers by fighting against DDoS attacks  (99). This joint initiative 
aims to share expertise and experience between its members, organise drills, communicate information to the public  and promote security standards to help protect against DDoS 
attacks. As part of the H orizon 2020 project CONCORDIA, ADC is developing the ‘ DDoS 
Clearing House’, a technical system allowing the continuous and automatic sharing of the 
metadata of DDoS attacks that have been processed by its members (duration of the 
attack, addresses , source IP, etc.). This tool consists of  an extra layer of security in addition 
to DDoS m itigation facilities that users must have in place. It aims to broaden users’ view of 
the DDoS attack landscape, while enabling them to proactively prepare their networks for 
an ongoing DDoS attack, thereby reducing the likelihood of disruption to critical  IS and 
associated consequences  (
100). 
• Analysis and way forward . ADC ’s collective management and mitigation model could inspire 
other types of coalition s. The principle could be the same, i.e.  bringing together cooperating 
organisations to improve the resilience of their digital services by fighting against a type of 
large- scale attack which has the potential to lead to a cyber crisis, such as supply chain 
attack and ransomware attack. These new coalitions would conduct three types of activities 
similar to ADC ’s, i.e. sharing metadata about attacks through a ‘c learing house’ (cf. supra),  
organising exercises to test the resilience of participants and sharing information. Its members can be public and/or private actors (government agencies, ISP s, banks, etc.). 
While the composition of a coalition can be cross -sectoral, it could also focus on a single 
specific essential or important sector (energy, health, financial market infrastructures, etc.), 
at the national or EU level s (
101).

 PHASE 2  – PREPAREDNESS  
The preparedness phase aims to prepare MS and the EU to manage crises by dev eloping plans 
to support response operations. This includes activities such as setting up a resilient crisis 
organisation, maintaining confidence within the ecosystem, prioritising the critical activities 
affected or ensuring that responders will know how to act by organising training sessions  and 
exercises. Preparedness measures are taken before crises occur.

Best practice #4: Definition of a governance structure, provision of specific capabilities 
and appointment of a crisis coordinator, whose nomination is mandatory under NIS2, 
and ensuring their department has the necessary operational and technical cyber skills 
to directly coordinate stakeholders during a cyber crisis . 
• Example . In Italy, the Director General of the National Cybersecurity Agency (ACN) was 
appointed as the national cyber crisis coordinator. While ACN covers the technical and operational levels in cybersecurity,  integrating the national CSIRT, the NIS point of contact  
and the Cybersecurity Team, it is also a member of the CSIRTs Network and EU -CyCLONe 
at the EU level, enabling it to benefit from shared situational awareness and information 
from other MS. As a result, its director g eneral has direct access to all the relevant 
information needed to efficiently support and advise the strategic level in the event of a Best Practices for C yber Crisis Management  
February 2024 
 
 
 33 cyber crisis (102). With its central position, the ACN bridges the gap between the strategic 
and technical levels and enables better coordination, fulfilling its mission as a key 
operational player.  
• Analysis and way forward  
• Designating an authority with operational and technical skills as cyber crisis 
coordinator speeds up decision-making, which is decisive for any crisis management. 
In the majority of  MS, the national cybersecurity authority has the necessary 
resources to ensure the national response to cyber incidents  (103). It often 
encompasses all the entities at the technical and operational level s, which greatly 
facilitates their mutual coordination and cooperation. As a member of the CSIRTs Network and EU -CyCLONe, it also has experience of cooperating with other MS, 
which is crucial when managing a cyber crisis at the EU level. This synergetic 
architecture is ideal for rapidly consolidating and correlating all the information, alerts 
and notifications of interest, from the detecti on of a cyber event to its potential 
escalation to the state of a cyber crisis, while ensuring that they are shared with other relevant government authorities. This type of entity therefore appears as the ideal 
player to act as a link between the different  levels and ensure an intelligent distribution 
of tasks, in order to prioritise and facilitate the work of all actors involved. It is  also in a 
privileged position to gather feedback and lessons learnt to improve processes after 
the crisis has ended, contr ibuting to improved prevention and mitigation of future 
crises. The entity would play a key role in managing the cyber crisis management plan and should be at the forefront of continuous process improvement  (
104). 
• For effective management and a 360° view of  the crisis, the entity should comprise 
staff from diverse backgrounds and mindsets, ranging from political scientists to 
engineers. The entity could also include experts in several key areas (judicial, sectoral 
issues, international relations, etc.) whose  specific expertise could be leveraged 
depending on the type of crisis, allowing to better understand and interact with all affected stakeholders in times of crisis  (
105). 
• Matching NIS2 objective  
• Article  9.1. Each Member State shall designate or establish one or more competent 
authorities responsible for the management of large- scale cybersecurity incidents and 
crises (cyber crisis management authorities). Member States shall ensure that those 
authorities have  adequate resources to carry out, in an effective and efficient manner, 
the tasks assigned to them. Member States shall ensure coherence with the existing frameworks for general national crisis management.  
Best practice #5: Mapping and gathering informatio n on critical entities and their most 
critical assets to enable rapid action.  
• Example . In France,  ‘operators of vital importance’ who have activities considered essential to 
the survival of the country must communicate a mapping of their IS to ANSSI  (
106). For 
example, a French maritime transport company regularly updates the mapping of its IS. It 
allows this company to have an ‘ up-to-date view of digital assets, including those linked to 
critical activities or hosting sensitive or regulated data’, but also to prioritise actions  ‘when 
not everything can be saved or isolated’ (107). The shipowner also considers that it is  
‘important to know which employees manage which systems, because they are often the 
only ones who can take the precise actions required ’. In addition, the mapping of the IS

 34 makes it possible to better understand the connections with customers and partners, and 
therefore to better communicate in the event of a crisis  (108). In this regard, as not all actors 
use the same security standards, ENISA has developed the ‘Interdependencies ’ web 
tool (109), which can be used to find the corresponding information securit y standards and 
frameworks of one standard to another.  
• Analysis and way forward . The precise mapping of IS of essential entities enables more 
effective operational coordination in the event of an incident. NIS2 deems that these 
systems are the most critical for MS, and also the most vulnerable given their exposure. 
The mapping of IS is essential for cyber crisis management. It relates directly to the 
defence of the IS by allowing for a rapid reaction in the event of an incident, to qualify the 
impact  thereof , or to prevent the consequences of the defensive actions carried out. 
Mapping also contributes to the resilience of the IS, since it is used to define, for example, the business continuity plan. These mappings, with regard to the critical nature of the 
activities of an essential entity, could be affixed with a mention of protection or even 
classification, according to the relevant rules of the MS. The competent authority could 
ensure that the mappings communicated by the essential entities have been developed, in 
addition to an approach focused on cybersecurity, to the highest level of granularity, by 
offering a complete view of the IS and all of its  ‘visions ’ (i.e. business, application, 
infrastructure) and its connection s with the outside. The competent authority could 
encourage essential entities to send regular updates, in particular during IS change or 
update of projects  (
110). MS could also consider retaining a degree of flexibility when 
drawing up these mappings, with the possibility of including entities of interest, even if not 
in the scope of NIS2, in their early warning systems, in order to improve responsiveness 
and cooperation with all parties concerned in the event of a crisis  (111). 
• Matching NIS2 objective  
• Article  3.3. By 17  April 2025, Member States shall establish a list of essential and 
important entities as well as entities providing domain name registration services. Member States shall review and, where appropriate, update that list on a regular basis 
and at least every 2 years thereafter.  
Best practice #6: Establishing instantaneous, secured communication channels during a 
crisis.  
• Example . In Germany, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is evaluating the 
‘Wire’ instant messaging system for the exchange of  ‘restricted ’ classified information. Its 
use is currently limited to the authorities connected to the federal government network. 
More than 30 ministries and authorities use it to exchange information at the restricted 
level (
112). However, an extension to users of the ‘ open network ’ is planned for a later phase 
of the project. This would give BSI a secure communication channel for collecting and 
exchanging sensitive information with private- sector stakeholders, which could be useful in 
responding to a cyber crisis, particularly when pooling information with affected critical infrastructures operators, or external security service providers  (
113). In terms of 
performance, Wire messaging enables end-to -end encrypted messages, including 
attachments, to be sent between two users and in secure group discussions. It is

 35 compatible with the main operating systems, and can be used on smartphones, tablets and 
computers  (114). 
• Analysis and way forward . In July 2019, an ENISA report highlighted that stakeholders 
engaged in incident response need secure and reliable communication channels to 
cooperate and share information (115). Insofar as the essential entities of a cyber crisis are 
involved in its management, it is important that knowledge be shared with the MS national cyber crisis management authorities, within the framework of a secure communications 
group. While several types of solution s can be used to create a group discussion, central 
messaging systems, such as Slack and Mattermost, stand out because they are easy to use, either as software as a service  or via a website. Given the sensitivity of the information 
exchanged, the MS national cyber crisis management authority could ensure that the choice of messaging system takes into account as many requirements as possible. While 
end-to -end encryption of discussions is the basic criterion, ENISA defines the following 
seven other features  (
116): 
• a uthentication of members using identity -based cryptography , 
• a rchiving so that all members  – even new ones  – can access and learn from past 
discussions , 
• e xchange of at tachments in all formats , 
• a n open specification to enable security audits , 
• a source code under an open source license, 
• a vailability on all major desktop and mobile operating systems , 
• a ‘ future-proof ’ maturity through the development of a stable business model.  
 Once the messaging system has been selected, the MS national cyber crisis management 
authority could define it as the default communication platform, even for the most informal 
exchanges, to make it easier for stakeholders to adapt to its use. The national cyber crisis 
management authority could, for instance , open channels including representatives from all 
relevant entities, to ensure smooth cooperation and rapid exchange of information, which 
would promote rapid action and greater flexibility. Such channels could be opened to critical 
operators, allowing information on vulnerabilities to be gathered and shared faster and in a 
more targeted manner, encouraging a faster reaction. Participants could exchange information on a more regular and informal basis, which would foster trust, a key factor in cyber crisis 
management. In the event of a crisis, more formal rules could be established on the platform, such as the use of specific templates to promote clear messaging, as well as specific 
chan nels for questions. Finally, any mapping of participants to be included in such channels 
ahead of the crisis should be regularly updated  (
117). 
• Matching NIS2 objectives

 36 of multi -factor authentication or continuous authentication solutions, secured voice, 
video and text communications and secured emergency communication systems 
within the entity, where appropriate.  
Best practice #7: Formalisation of a clear allocation of roles among  the stakeholders 
involved in responding to a cyber crisis in an overall plan.  
• Example . In 2017, Belgium adopted a National Cyber Emergency Plan which is subject to 
annual evaluation and, if necessary, deve lopment  (118). The Centre for Cyber security 
Belgium (CCB) and the National Crisis Centre are responsible for implementing this 
confidential document, which was designed as a basis for the operational aspects of cyber 
crisis management at national level. Depending on the intensity of the inci dent, the plan 
describes the procedures and security measures to be followed. It formalises the framework for collaboration between the various competent services, and  their tasks within 
the limits of their legal and regulatory powers, to regain control of  the situation as quickly as 
possible (CCB  and its CERT.be service, the National Crisis Centre , the Public Prosecutor, 
Police services, etc.). The plan also promotes the rapid and correct exchange of 
information between services  (
119). 
• Analysis and way forward . The key to an effective coordinated response to a cyber crisis is 
a strict division of roles between the relevant authorities. Drawing up an overall plan 
detailing the framework for action by the players to be involved, as well as their missions 
and obligations, helps to prevent overlap throughout  the crisis. This document could take 
into account the nuances and complexities of the cyber crisis and propose, according to several scenarios, the operations and successive measures to be put in place at  the 
national level, but also in cooperation with E U partners. It should be regularly updated, 
based on experience, feedback and technical progress, in order to develop a MS national 
cyber crisis management framework. While the overall plan for operations must be 
confidential for security reasons, the development of a common base for all the MS could encourage and promote a common culture of response to cyber crises across the EU. EU -
CyCLONe could be tasked with contributing to this coordination between MS.

 37 • Example . In 2018, the members of the NIS Cooperation Group published a cybersecurity 
incident taxonomy  (120). This taxonomy provides a common, simple and high-level 
classification for cybersecurity incidents at the strategic and policy level s, and was 
designed to facilitate the exchange of information across borders and international 
collaboration. The taxonomy assesses the cyber incident according to its nature ( the 
underlying cause that triggered the incident) and its impact on services and specific  sector s 
of the economy/society, as follows:  
• nature , 
• root cause category: s ystem failures, natural phenomena, human error, malicious 
actions, third-party failures , 
• severity of the threat : high, medium, low , 
• impact , 
• sectors impacted : energy, transport, banking, finance, health, drinking water, digital 
infrastructure, communications, trust and identification services, digital services, 
government services , 
• scale of the national impact  for the economy and society : red – very large impact, 
yellow  – marginal impact, green  – minor impact, white – no impact , 
• outlook, i.e. the prognosis for the impact for the economy and society: 
improving, stable, worsening . 
This taxonomy is only for ‘naming’ cyber incidents and does not include processes to, for 
example,  notify or escalat e incidents . 
• Analysis and way forward . While the above was developed for the strategic level, it could 
serve as a basis for operational players to assess and qualify a cyber incident as a crisis 
using clear escalation criteria. These could lead to the activation of the cyber crisis plan 
required by NIS2, in order to deploy appropriate measures proportionate to the scale of the 
crisis. In the future, such a measure could build on the work of the NIS Cooperation Group, 
bringing an operational perspective that not only qualifies cybersecurity incidents, but al so 
addresses processes to be implemented depending on the level of the crisis. The establishment of escalation criteria would provide a coherent mechanism for objectively 
assessing cyber incidents, determining the actors to be involved according to the 
seriousness of the incident and informing decision-makers at all levels of the nature and 
speed of the response and the procedures to be adopted. These escalation criteria could be developed at the national or the  EU level, for instance through a working group 
coordinated by EU -CyCLONe and involving actors from both the strategic and technical 
levels , and could be integrated in national crisis plans. While common criteria may be 
difficult to agree upon, MS should endeavour to reach a mutual understanding, either by adopting a common approach or by developing a tool for rapid understanding, using EU -
CyCLONe. Rather than proposing common definitions, this tool would provide an 
equivalence scale matching varying concepts in the different MS.  
• Matching NIS2 objectives

 38 Best practice #9: Development of a methodology and risk assessment tools to optimise 
coordination and interoperability in the event of a crisis.  
• Example . The Polish Cybersecurity Strategy (2018) for 2019 –2024 sets as an objective the 
development and implementation of a risk -assessment approach, a Polish government 
priority for the establishment of a national cybersecurity system. The strategy proposes a 
‘joint static and dynamic risk -assessment methodology which takes into account the 
specificity of individual sectors, critical-infrastructure operators, operators of essential services, and digital service providers, shall be introduced for the purpose of cybersecurity 
management at the national level ’ (
121). In this way, the government intends to facilitate the 
comparison of assessments and risk levels, particularly for reporting on national security risks, in line with crisis management regulations  (
122). As a result, risk assessmen t becomes 
a continuous process which allows the level of risk to be identified in near real time (123). 
The Polish government developed a risk assessment method and tools through the 
National Cybersecurity Platform, a project aimed at creating a prototype f or ‘a 
comprehensive, integrated system for monitoring, imaging and warning of threats [to the state ’s cyberspace]’. This platform is intended to help prevent, detect and minimise the 
effects of cyber incidents on the information and communication systems that are important to the functioning of the state, while also promoting information sharing on cyber 
threats  (
124). 
• ENISA has published several reports on risk assessment and interoperability, including 
Interoperable EU Risk Assessment Toolbox  (2023)  (125) and Interoperable EU Risk 
Assessment Framework (2023)  (126). The former  (127) aims to address interoperability issues 
related to the use of IS risk management methods to facilitate the seamless integration of 
risk management methods within and between organisations, bridging gaps between different approaches. It thus promotes a common understanding of the risks of 
interoperable risk assessment results. The latter  (
128) proposes a methodology to evaluate 
the potential interoperability of risk management frameworks  and methods, proposing, for 
example, a four -level scale to assess the d egree of interoperability of each method and set 
of characteristics combined.  
• Analysis and way forward . The development of a risk assessment methodology and tools is 
essential to enable a progressive approach to the management of large- scale cyber 
incidents and crises. It not only improves coordination and cooperation between the various 
levels  – strategic,  operational and technical – through improved mutual understanding, but 
also between MS. It is a key measure for promoting information sharing, while at the same time proposing ways of interconnecting and harmonising national approaches. In particular, 
the operational level would play a key role in bridging the gaps between all the 
stakeholders involved. This approach could also solve some of the problems associated with the difficulty of defining the notion of a cybersecurity crisis and the subjectivity of  what 
is considered a cyber crisis across MS. It could also easily be integrated into national and 
European general crisis management frameworks. EU -CyCLONe could elaborate such a 
methodology, bringing together the perspectives of the MS.

• national procedures and arrangements between relevant national authorities and 
bodies to ensure the Member State ’ s effective participation in and support of the 
coordinated management of large-scale cybersecurity incidents and crises at the 
EU level . 
Best practice #10: Test the overall plan for operations in response to cyber crises 
through a multi -annual programme of cyber crisis management exercises and trainings. 
• Examples  
• Finland has been organising major joint cybersecurity exercises for several years. For 
the Finnish Transport and Communication Agency ’s National Cyber Security Centre, 
these exercises aim to create common situational awareness and coordinating 
activities between participants and their partners, rather than improving its own 
internal processes  (129). 
• At the EU level, ENISA has been organising local, international and EU -wide 
exercises for the pa st 15  years, developing cyber exercise platforms available to 
stakeholders so they may host their own exercises. T he agency organises  the 
following specific exercises to test cyber crisis management : 
• Cyber Europe , the biannual exercise simulating large- scale cybersecurity 
incidents which escalate into cyber crises, for both the public and private sectors  
from the EU and European Free Trade Association MS  (130), 
• CyberSOPex,  the biannual exercise to test the CSIRTs Network SOPs , 
• CySOPex,  the biannual exercise to test the Eu-CyCLONe Officers ’ SOPs for 
rapid EU cyber crisis management when faced with large-scale cross -border 
cyber incidents and crises  (131), 
• BlueOLEx , the annual exercise to test the Eu-CyCLONe Executives ’ SOPs for 
rapid EU cyber crisis management when faced with large-scale cross -border 
cyber incidents and crises.  
• Analysis and way forward . The programming of cyber exercises over several years could 
help to develop and strengthen MS ’ national cyber crisis management frameworks. These 
exercises should not be considered as isolated events, but rather as a series forming a coherent whole enabling the continuous improvement of all stakeholders, as well as the 
evolution of capabilities requirements  (
132). They could involve all three levels (strategic, 
operational, technical), around operational level actors as the federating level, to bridge the gap between the strategic and technical levels. In order to identify training needs, a survey 
could be conducted at the EU level. Then, in order to match the needs identified, the 
following phases should be followed: selecting the type of exercise, setting up a planning team, preparing the exercise, supporting observers, carrying out the exercise, providing 
feedback and drawing lessons learned. Rather than repeating similar exercises every few

 40 months, different types of exercises could be programmed (tabletop exercise, functional 
exercise, major joint exercise), just as scenarios could be expanded to involve a growing 
number  of players and critical sectors. Examples of programmes could include, but are not 
limited to:  
• a series of smaller exercises, workshops, and training s ession, which could be 
organised more frequently throughout the year, and on specific topics: this would allow participants to benefit from regular reminders about new things they have 
learned, promote a common vocabulary and knowledge base and build trust 
between participants  (
133), 
• e xercises taking into account a sectoral approach, mobilising representative s from 
critical sectors (banking, energy, transport, etc.) to facilitate discussions between 
the sector and regulators, promote mutual understanding and improve trust and 
information sharing (134), 
• e xercises including anticipation scenarios, to prepare and improve response in the 
event that stakeholders are faced with new situations for which there are not yet clear operational procedures  (
135). 
By practising the management of a series of large- scale incidents under realistic conditions, 
the MS cyber crisis management authorities, the operators of critical and important entities 
and partners develop methods and reflexes for dealing with real crises  (136). These exercises 
could also be used to test internal procedures (such as b usiness continuity plans) and 
external procedures (such as the quality of information sharing)  (137). The transposition of NIS2 
into national legislation will require MS to adopt response plans for large-scale cyber security incidents and crises, making the organisation of exercises to test national cyber crisis plans 
particularly relevant.  
• Matching  NIS2 objective  
• Article 9.4.d. Each Member State shall adopt a national large -scale cybersecurity 
incident and crisis response plan where the objectives of and arrangements for the 
management of large- scale cybersecurity incidents and crises are set out. That plan 
shall lay down, in particular: national preparedness measures, including exercises and training activities.  
 
Best practice #11: Setting up training sessions for current and future staff responsible 
for cyber crisis management at the operational level.  
• Example . In Portugal, the National Defence Institute has set up a short -term programme 
called ‘Cyber Security and Crisis Management in Cyberspace Course’ . The course, which 
is open by selection, is aimed at senior and middle-level government managers, armed forces and security officers, diplomats, civil society organisations, academics and 
executives. It prepares them to intervene in the event of a cyber crisis, in particular by promoting the sharing of knowledge, while disseminating a strategic culture of 
cybersecurity. Among the five teaching modules, which aim to raise awareness and provide 
training in the various issues at stake in the digital space (security, technology, economy, 
etc.), the ‘ Strategic Decision Exercise ’ module endeavours  ‘to encourage and raise relevant 
issues related to crisis management situations in cyberspace’ among the attendees , in 
order  ‘to improve processes and provide methodologies to be used in decision -
making ’ (
138).

 41 • Analysis and way forward . Regular training cycles help to train and improve the skills of 
personnel responsible for managing cyber crises. In particular, modules specifical ly 
dedicated to the operational level could help to bring together the public and private 
managers (representatives of the national cyber crisis management authority of the M S, 
key and important entities, etc.) who will be required to work together during a cyber crisis, in order to clearly determine the division of tasks and individual roles. As well as 
exchanging best practice in cyber crisis management, such training would enable the 
operational level to be better integrated at the technical and strategic levels. For example, 
participants could develop and test their knowledge of threat analysis, situation assessment 
and mitigation measures through feedback, lessons learned and cyber crisis exercises. 
This type of training could be delivered via an e-learning platform to allow regular updating 
of knowledge. The educational content of this platform could be populated by the MS’ 
national cyber crisis management authority, in coordination with EU -CyCLONe.  
• Matching NIS2 objective  
• Article  9.4.d.  Each Member State shall adopt a national large-scale cybersecurity 
incident and crisis response plan where the objectives of and arrangements for the 
management of large- scale cybersecurity incidents and crises are set out. That plan 
shall lay down, in particular: national preparedness measures, including exercises and training activities.  
 Best practice #12: Development of a communication strategy, including a clear format for 
messaging, stakeholders to involve, priority levels and time factor and communication channels to be used.  
• Example . The Netherlands has developed its communication strategy around the ad hoc  
establishment of a National Central Crisis Communication Team. Th is is made up of 
communication professionals from the National Crisis Centre and relevant ministries. The 
team  coordinates the central government ’s communication with Dutch society and the 
press, as well as with the other MS, on the crisis and its visible consequences. As part of a unified approach, it coordinates the timetable and content of messages from all the public 
and private actors involved, who must express themselves on their own responsibility on 
their own subjects. For example, local authorities only comment on the implementation of 
security measures at their level, private companies on the consequences of the crisis on 
their employees, customers and suppliers, and ministries on the prospects for action at the  
national level in their areas. In the run -up to a crisis, the centre’s  Communications 
Department coordinates communications between central government and public and 
private partners, providing them with advice, resources and a network of crisis communication experts as required (
139). 
• Analysis and way forward . A crisis communication strategy defines the rules for delivering a 
clear message at the right time. In the cyber domain, the challenge is to communicate 
proactively to prevent doubt in public opinion, even though identifying the causes and 
consequences of  an incident is always uncertain. Whatever the organisation of crisis 
management, a competent unit or department should be designated to coordinate the timing and content of messages, in the interest of a unified and coherent discourse. These 
communications experts should be included in all meetings, at all stages and at all levels, 
to contribute to managing the crisis. It is therefore crucial that roles are allocated upstream 
to clarify the communication tasks  of each government actor. Given the complexity  of cyber 
issues, it seems important that the designated communicators master the technical 
vocabulary, the challenge being to make the general public understand the complexities of 
a cyber crisis. They must be able to respond effectively to requests for information, both internal (government departments, public partners, etc.) and external (press, citizens, 
foreign partners, etc.). In terms of deadlines and content, the aim is to inform the public as

 42 quickly as possible about what is known, what is not yet  known and what measures have 
been taken. Until it is certain that a cyber crisis is the result of deliberate action, reference 
to possible causes, duration and scale should be avoided as far as possible.

• Article  9.3. Each Member State shall identify capabilities, assets and procedures that

 PHASE 3  – RESPONSE 
The response phase aims to stem the cyber crisis and prevent further damage. At the EU level, 
response is based on effec tive technical, operational and strategic cooperation between MS. An 
effective and safe response involves activating predetermined measures. These measures are 
taken during crises.

BP #1 4. Supporting victims ’ crisis communication , for instance with a unified 
and transparent message  
 
Best practice #13: Encourage the mobilisation of private -sector certified  ‘trusted 
providers ’ to provide technical assistance to victims.  
• Examples  
• In May 2023, BSI published its list of qualified service providers for responding to 
advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks  (140). Following a particularly powerful and 
sophisticated attack (but also beforehand as a preventive measure), German 
essential entities can consult this list to quickly request assistance from one of these 
approved actors. Qualified service providers are priv ate companies selected in two 
stages: applicants must first provide BSI with full documentation for assessment (description of products and services, compliance with defined criteria, existing 
certifications, etc.), then conduct a technical interview at BS I, during which they must 
prove their ability to manage an incident in a professional manner, in the framework of a fictitious scenario. Qualified security service providers are presented on the BSI ’s 
list according to a number of performance characteristi cs, including 24x7 availability, 
ISO 27001 certification, head office location, internal resources for APT incident 
response, ability to provide other services (legal, crisis communication, etc.), and  
technical equipment.  
• ANSSI has drawn up a set of requirements for security incident response providers, a 
set of rules for providers to obtain qualification for their services in this area. It covers 
requirements relating to the incident response provider, its staff and the way in which 
incident response services are provided. The following activities are eligible for 
qualification: system, network and malicious code analysis, and  technical monitoring.

 43 This standard was drawn up in consultation with market players and is regularly 
updated (141). 
• Analysis and way forward . The certification of trusted private-sector security service 
providers could be encouraged to assist targeted critical infrastructure operators. Given the 
potentially large number of organisations affected during a cyber crisis, the mobilisation of 
these partners would relieve national cyber crisis management authorities which, if they lack the resources to act on all fronts, could concentrate on other tasks with higher added 
value. Certified trusted security incident response service providers, approved in advance 
and compliant with high-level requirements, could be called on directly by an essential 
entity. To provide an overview of the market for these approved providers, the MS 
competent authority could publish a directory, enabling the appropr iate partner to be found 
quickly in case of emergency. This list could briefly present  certified trusted security service 
providers, their contact details and their performance characteristics, allowing for a kind of 
pre-approved, trusted pool of experts. In order to avoid time- consuming research when 
responding to a cyber crisis, the MS national cyber crisis management authority could ensure that all essential entities have contracted a partnership with a certified trusted 
security service provider. However, authorities should establish clear procedures for 
certifying these suppliers, in order to avoid distorting the market and to leave little room for 
subjectivity and interpretation, in order to maintain a high level of transparency and 
accountability  (
142). 
• Matching  NIS2 objective  
• Article  9.4.e . Each Member State shall adopt a national large -scale cybersecurity 
incident and crisis response plan where the objectives of and arrangements for the management of large- scale cybersecurity incidents and crises are set out. That plan 
shall lay down, in particular: the relevant public and private stakeholders and infrastructure involved.  
Best practice #14: Supporting victims ’ crisis communication , for instance with a unified 
and transparent message. 
• Example . In 2017, a car manufacturer was forced to halt production at several of its plants as 
a result of the WannaCry attack. It was the first company to acknowledge being a victim of 
this large-scale attack , which disrupted the systems of several organisations across the EU. 
The company explained it was doing ‘everything necessary to counter this attack’ , 
stating that the first step of the management procedure was to set up measures to stop the 
spread of the virus  (
143). Two days later, the Director General of ANSSI spoke to the main 
French media outlets to say that his teams were working with those of this company , and 
those of companies that chose to remain anonymous, which he refused to name. He added 
that ANSSI was  ‘really trying to restore as quickly as possible in the most problematic 
cases ’ (144). His message was quickly picked up by the regional daily press and the 
specialist press, contributing to the company ’s transparency and therefore to the protection 
of its reputation. 
• Analysis and way forward . The main source of information in managing a cyber crisis should 
ideally be the organisation that is the victim of the  crisis. It is essential for it to be proactive 
and take the initiative, but not in a hurry. Lies, silence or passivity should be avoided at all 
costs. To protect the organisation’ s reputation, the cyber crisis management authority can 
support the victim organisation ’s communication to avoid uncertainty. The communications 
team of the national cyber crisis management authority should be inv olved at all times, to

 44 help in managing the crisis  (145). This approach does not mean that everything should be 
said. As a general rule, it is important to gain time until the extent of the situation is better 
understood. As the Spanish National Cryptologic Centre states in its report dedicated to 
good practices  in the management of cyber crisis,  ‘any communication shall avoid 
mentioning the causes of the incident, the person responsible for it, information that the investigation may reveal or the possible consequences for the organisation or another 
stakeholder ’ (
146). 
• Matching NIS2 objective  
• Article  9.3. Each Member State shall identify capabilities, assets and procedures that

 PHASE 4  – RECOVERY 
The recovery phase aims to enable the MS and the EU to recover quickly by taking measures , 
as soon as the crisis is over , to return to a level of security that is normal or even higher than 
before the crisis. Activities include restoring and reintegrating affected systems and 
arrangements or organising lessons learned to better prevent, respond to and mitigate future 
crises. Such measures are taken after crises occur.

BP #1 6. Establish a unit tasked with gathering feedback, drawing lessons learnt and producing 
recommendations for reviewing, updating and modifying procedures and refining the action plan for 
cyber crisis management  
 
Best practice #15: Develop and implement BRP defined in reference frameworks, with 
regular reviewing and updates, in consultation with relevant stakeholders.  
• Example . Predefined frameworks such as NIST 800-34, BS 25999- 1, APS 232, NFPA 1600, 
COBIT, HB 292 -2006 or PAS 77 can be used as part of a BRP  (147). National cybersecurity 
agencies provide guides to help impacted entities  recover from a cyber crisis, which could 
be used to develop robust BRP at a national level. For example, Fr ance’s ANSSI has 
developed a guide proposing a gradual approach, describing the different phases that 
impacted entities should follow to recover their assets and gradually resume their 
activities  (148). 
• Analysis and way forward . National cyber crisis management authorities must support the 
victims of a cyber crisis until its end, i.e. when the essential activities concerned can 
resume as usual. The measures to be taken in this respect must be formulated in advance 
to enable smooth activation at the end of a crisis, as part of a BRP and should be regularly 
updated with lessons learned. The BRP is the final component of a b usiness continuity plan 
that groups together all the measures that an organisation (public institution, private 
company, etc.) must take as soon as a crisis occurs in order to continue operating. It also

 45 includes a business recovery plan, which precedes the BRP and is used to re-establish the 
processes of the ICT or IS teams following an incident. Indeed, the notions of  ‘recovery ’ 
and ‘ resumption ’ should be distinguished: recovery  refers to the return of operations back 
to normal,  while  resum ption refers to the return to business with less capacity and in a 
different environment  (149), gradually bringing back into service the digital tools and 
infrastructure affected. The se plans should be developed  in consultation with the different 
stakeholders inv olved in cyber crisis management , in order to promote a holistic approach. 
National cyber crisis authorities could also develop guides for different kinds of 
stakeholders such as essential and important entities, but also smaller structure s which 
may not have the internal resources to develop such plans.  
• Matching NIS2 objective  
• Article  21.1.  Member States shall ensure that essential and important entities take 
appropriate and proportionate technical, operational and organisational measures t o 
minimise the impact of incidents on recipients of their services and on other services.  
Best practice #16: Establishment of a unit tasked with gathering feedback, drawing 
lessons learnt and producing recommendations for reviewing, updating and modifying 
procedures and infrastructure, and refining the action plan for cyber crisis management . 
• Example . In February 2021, a hospital in France  was the target of a ransomware attack, 
forcing it to reschedule surgical operations. ANSSI was called in to conduct technical investigations. After the crisis, all the teams involved were mobilised in two stages, firstly in a ‘hotwash ’ session and then at a later date. The aim of these feedback sessions was to 
‘question and improve the practices and procedures of  [the] business lines ’, with a view to 
being even ‘ more resilient in the event of a long- lasting crisis ’ (
150). 
• Analysis and way forward  
• In order to develop the cyber crisis management framework, both for the MS and for 
the organisation affected, each crisis could be immediately followed by the 
organisation of a feedback session, which would later be evaluated within 
30 days  (151). 
• As soon as the crisis is over, a team could be identified to interview the relevant 
actors, according to a defined timetable and interview methods. Several themes could 
be addressed, including governance and the crisis management process, crisis 
communication, the decision -making and action- monitoring process, technical and 
operational capabilities and interactions with external stakeholders. The interviews could lead to the drafting of a summary document, which could be supplemented by a 
digital investigation commissioned from service providers.  
• Based on the data collected, the team would then draft an action plan aimed at 
improving the national crisis management framework. Feedback could be organised 
at the level of the MS cyber crisis management authority, which would receive a 
summary report for its management, along with a more comprehensive document for 
the technical teams.  
• Matching NIS2 objective  
• Article  9.3. Each Member State shall identify capabilities, assets and procedures that 
can be deployed in the case of a crisis  …

 46 5. RECOMMENDATIONS  
This final chapter provides a list of recommendations for future development of cyber crisis 
management at the operational level in the EU.  
The best practices identified in this study highlight a number of gaps in cyber crisis management 
at the operational level in the EU. The imminent transposition of NIS2 into national legislation 
will formalise the creation of national cyber crisis management authorities. The latter will have to 
collaborate with – at the MS level  – all competent actors in cyber crisis management , including 
essential entities, and – at the EU level  – their E U counterparts through EU -CyCLONe. A 
number of initiatives could be taken to maximise these efforts.  
Based on the analysis and the way forward of the best practices  (152), EU -CyCLONe could 
consider the following recommendations . 
Recommendation #1 . Coordinate working sessions involving all MS to define a list of EU -wide 
cyber crisis mechanisms to enable a common assessment of incidents and identify the players to be involved depending on the severity of the incident, leading to a model cyber crisis 
response pl an. These cyber crisis management mechanisms could be regularly updated in line 
with progress made by the MS, particularly in terms of human and technical resources, situational awareness and impact assessment. They should always be part of overarching 
national crisis management frameworks, considering the transboundary nature of most crises 
and the potential for spill -over effect impacting many sectors at the same time.  
Recommendation #2 . Develop simulation exercises at the EU level which test the operational 
level players and procedures in particular. These exercises, which should involve all three levels 
(strategic, operational and technical), aim to practice the allocation of tasks, cooperation and 
fluidity of action of the MS during a cyber cris is. Actors in charge of cyber crisis management 
must know each other well to trust one another. To ensure continuity, coherence and overall consistency, each exercise could be organised on the basis of the results of the previous one. 
The exercises would t hus test the operational level ’s ability to coordinate and exchange 
information, assess the situation, act as the CSIRTs ’ interpreter with political decision -makers 
and manage crisis communication with stakeholders. EU -CyCLONe can play a key role not only 
in strengthening capacity -building but also developing long-lasting trust among MS.  
Recommendation #3 . Support MS in the set -up of secure communication platform(s) to 
exchange information with essential entities, including for informal communication, during a 
cyber crisis. While the platforms selected by MS should obviously be the result of national 
choices, EU -CyCLONe could help the  choices by publishing guidelines, and even comparative 
analyses, about the messaging systems best suited to cooperate and exc hange information in 
complete confidentiality.  
Recommendation #4 . Ensure that MS national cyber crisis management authorities, in 
coordination with the NIS Cooperation Group (
153), regularly update critical IS maps of essential 
entities in their country. To do so, they could encourage essential entities to send regular 
updates, in particular during IS change or project update s. Precise maps are essential for cyber 
crisis management, enabling more effective operational coordination in the event of an incident. 
 
(152) See Chapter  4 ‘Cyber crisis management best practices in the EU ’. 
(153) According to Article 14.4 of NIS2 , the NIS Cooperation Group is responsible for providing strategic guidance to EU -CyCLONe 
and for exchanging information relating  to the identification of essential and important entities.  Best Practices for C yber Crisis Management

 47 They contribute to a rapid reaction in the event of an incident, to qualify the impact or to prevent 
the consequences of the defensive actions carried out.  
Recommendation #5 . Support the organisation of media training sessions for executives of MS 
national cyber crisis management authorities, so that they can give coherent and clear updates 
on the progress of the crisis, in any type of media (press, radio, TV, social networks). As  each 
MS has its own capacity needs, these communication sessions could be organised at the 
national level, with content adapted to the context of the MS. EU crisis communicators could 
regularly follow awareness -raising sessions on cyber issues, as well as  refresher courses . 
National and E U cyber crisis management procedures will doubtless continue to evolve. Based 
on the experience of MS (and beyond), ENISA should continue to identify best practices on a 
regular basis, beginning once NIS2 has been implemented in all MS.

File: FCC performance1999.pdf
Content:
The Honorable William J. Clinton
 President of the United States
The White House
Washington, D. C. 20500
Dear Mr. President:
Attached for your review is the Federal Communications Commission’s Annual
Performance Report for Fiscal Year 1999.
We are pleased with the results of our efforts.  We met or partially met sixty of
our sixty-nine goals—an 87 percent success rate.   In addition to our program goals, we
embarked on an ambitious course of action to completely revise our Strategic Plan to
ensure that our plan reflects the goals of a converging and increasingly global
telecommunications industry.  In redoing our plan, we reached out to industry, to state,
regional, and local governments, to academe and consumer interest groups, and to our
own employees to provide us with input into the plan.  In August 1999, we issued a draft
Strategic Plan that, I believe, provides measurable, results-oriented performance goals for
the next five years.
Another notable achievement in Fiscal Year 1999 was the completion of our plan
to consolidate our enforcement and consumer information activities.  Historically, the
FCC has been organized along the traditional lines of wire, wireless, satellite, broadcast
and cable communications.  This traditional structure no longer makes sense in an era
when the lines dividing many communications service providers are blurring.
Consolidation of our consumer information services will allow us to provide improved
information services to consumers facing a bewildering choice of competing
telecommunications services.  Centralization of our enforcement activities will allow us
to respond quickly and efficiently to questionable activities in an increasingly deregulated
marketplace.  Moreover, our consumer information and enforcement staff will share
information that will enable us to spot trends and areas of consumer and industry
concern.
I would also like to note that we achieved this level of success despite some
formidable programmatic obstacles, including:
• A multi-phased, logistically complex agency move that required that we maintain
duplicate operations for seven months.  This move, and the need to maintain two
separate sites, challenged our resources, particularly our information technology
infrastructure;• An in-depth review of all our mission critical automated processing systems to ensure
that each system was fully Year-2000 compliant.  This effort required a months-long
review and testing of our major systems and the identification of all smaller systems
that required conversion before December 31, 1999.
• In addition, we completed a Business Continuity and Contingency Plan for every
automated system, major or minor, in case our reviews failed to identify all Y2k
problems.  The need to complete these reviews and contingency plans resulted in our
deferring scheduled enhancements or replacements to several major licensing and
document management systems;
• Failure to obtain the necessary funding in Fiscal Year 1999 to upgrade our network
infrastructure and to complete several of the performance goals specified in our Fiscal
Year 1999 Annual Performance Plan. For example, we deferred completion of the
implementation of two of the Mass Media Bureau’s electronic filing systems and an
agency-wide electronic document management system.  We plan to complete work on
these systems in Fiscal Year 2000, if additional funding can be obtained.
I look forward to hearing your comments on our Annual Performance Plan.
Sincerely,
William E. Kennard
Chairman

FISCAL YEAR 1999 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT
Functional Area : Authorization of Service
Objective:  #1 We will meet our established customer Speed of Disposal processing goals.
1999 Performance GoalsGoal
Met?
(Y/N)1999 Actual Performance
(If goal not met, provide explanation, planned remedy, and target date
for meeting goal) Method of Measurement
(Performance Indicators)
We will review our authorization of
service rules and will simplify and
streamline those authorization
requests where appropriate.Yes The FCC made significant progress in simplifying and streamlining authorization of service
rules in Fiscal Year 1999.  In common carrier matters, we eliminated entry certification
requirements under Section 214 of the Communications Act and approved a streamlined
authorization process for international applications that will qualify approximately 99 percent
of applications for 14-day processing.  In May, we adopted an order substantially revising and,
in some cases, eliminating the International Settlements Policy.  We also streamlined electronic
filing of 15 key broadcast application and reporting forms, representing 88 percent of all
broadcast authorization forms.  A competitive bidding process was approved to replace the
comparative hearing process for the selection of mutually exclusive broadcast applicants.  We
adopted new, simplified rules for the equipment authorization process, deregulating the
equipment authorization requirements for certain types of equipment, and providing for
electronic filing.  Finally, we are nearing completion on the development and implementation
of a Universal Licensing System that provides streamlined electronic Internet filing capabilities
for most wireless services, provides application and tracking status information and reduces the
number of wireless application forms from 63 to five.Performance was measured through a
review and analysis of authorization of
service data and other workload reports
provided by the Bureaus and Offices.
We will meet 90% of our customer
Speed of Disposal processing
goals.Partially
MetThe majority of license applications in all services were processed within established
timeframes.  Those services where the goal was not met were impacted by a variety of
situations including efforts to develop and implement new electronic, Internet accessible, filing
systems, Y2K compliancy issues, the convergence of technologies and industries that created
significant complications in the traditional licensing processes, and agency-wide efforts to
reduce backlogged applications.  We anticipate that we will make significant progress in
meeting our processing goals in Fiscal Year 2000.Performance was measured through
analysis of data contained in internal
workload reports.2We will provide electronic filing
capabilities for CCB, MMB, IB,
WTB, and OET licensing systems.
 We will improve our Speed of
Disposal and public access to the
status of license applications by
integrating Wireless
Telecommunications Bureau’s ten
licensing systems into a single,
integrated database.-We will
improve our Speed of Disposal and
public access to the status of
license applications by re-
engineering and integrating 13
Mass Media Bureau licensing and
authorization of service databases.
  -We will improve our Speed of
Disposal and improve public access
to information through
implementation of redesigned, fully
automated Equipment
Authorization and Experimental
Radio Service licensing systems.Mostly
MetIn Fiscal Year 1999 we continued to implement electronic filing capabilities including systems
in the Common Carrier, International, Wireless Telecommunications Bureaus, and the Office
of Engineering and Technology. Our Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has deployed 7 out
of the ten commercial wireless services as part of its Universal Service Licensing System. Our
Mass Media Bureau has developed electronic licensing capabilities for all of its services and
licensing systems.  However, access to the public was delayed due to Y2k preparation priorities
and budgetary constraints.  Full implementation of these systems is dependent on adequate
funding in Fiscal Year 2000.Performance is measured by the number of
authorization systems reengineered, the
number of electronic filing systems
implemented, and the effect of both on our
licensees.
We will provide immediate access
to routine common carrier Local
Access Transport Area
modifications by placing these
electronically on public notice upon
receipt.Yes All routine common carrier Local Access Transport Area modifications are now immediately
placed on public notice and are accessible electronically through the Commission’s Digital
Index. The comment and reply period for such requests is typically limited to 3 weeks.  An
order addressing the requested modification matters is issued approximately 60 days from the
date of original filing.Performance was measured by changes in
the common carrier Local Access Transport
Area modification processing to provide
immediate access.
We will allow telecommunications
carriers wishing to add new or to
discontinue old lines to obtain
authority under Section 214 with
no regulatory delays.Yes On June 30, 1999, we released a Report and Order revising Part 63 rules eliminating the
requirement to file applications for entry authority.  This order also stipulated that applications
for discontinuance would be granted automatically. Since these rules were implemented, no
entry applications have been filed, and all but two applications for discontinuance have been
allowed to become effective automatically.Performance was measured by the adoption
of rule changes to reduce or eliminate
regulatory delays.3Functional Area : Authorization of Service
Objective:  #2 We will utilize spectrum auctions whenever feasible for efficient licensing and innovative use of
the electromagnetic spectrum allowing the most advantageous use of the scarce spectrum and expedited new
customer services.

(Performance Indicators)
We will meet all Congressionally-
mandated auction schedules in FY
1999.Yes There were no Congressionally-mandated auctions during Fiscal Year 1999.  The FCC did
conduct six auctions that awarded approximately 1,700 licenses for $640 million.There were no Congressionally--mandated
auctions.4Functional Area : Authorization of Service
Objective:  #3 We will encourage competition in the telecommunications industry through efficient licensing
and authorization of service to competitive services.

(Performance Indicators)
We will meet 90% of our customer
Speed of Disposal goals.Mostly
MetThe majority of license applications in all services were processed within established time
frames. In several services customer goals were not met due to a variety of reasons—including
efforts to develop and implement new electronic filing systems, Y2K compliancy issues, and
an agency-wide effort to eliminate backlogged applications.  We expect to make significant
progress in meeting our customer service goals in Fiscal Year 2000, given the funding required
to continue our implementation of electronic filing  systems.Performance was measured through
analysis of data contained in internal
workload reports.5Functional Area : Policy and Rulemaking
Objective : #1 We will restructure and streamline the FCC, eliminating outdated or redundant organizations
and overlapping regulations.
1999 Performance GoalsGoal
Met?
(Y/N)1999 Actual Performance
(If goal not met, provide explanation, planned remedy, and target date
for meeting goal) Method of Measurement
(Performance Indicators)
We will continue to use our
forbearance authority where
appropriate.Yes The Commission issued 24 orders addressing petitions for forbearance in FY 1999. Performance was measured by review of
Orders issued in connection with parties’
requests for forebearance from regulation.
We will review the FCC’s functions
and structures and eliminate obsolete
or overlapping ones .Yes In Fiscal Year 1999, the FCC completed all planning for the consolidation of its enforcement
and consumer information activities.  The consolidation of these two key functions will
improve efficiency and enhance the delivery on consumer information and enforcement
services to the general public and to industry.  In Fiscal Year 1998, the FCC conducted an
agency-wide biennial review to eliminate, consolidate, and/or revise rules that were obsolete or
outdated.  During Fiscal Year 1999, the FCC completed rulemakings streamlining accounting,
reporting, and depreciation rules and released an order finding that it should privatize its
accounting authority in maritime radio services. We  also commenced Phase I of a
Comprehensive Accounting Review to further review areas of possible streamlining.  For other
actions, see next entry.Performance was measured by a
determination that the 1998 Biennial
Regulatory Review was completed and by a
review of other actions taken during FY
1999 that further reduced obsolete or
overlapping functions.
We will continue to evaluate whether
certain regulations are no longer
necessary in the public interest and
should be repealed or modified as
required by Section 11 of the
Communications Act and Section
202(h) of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996.Yes As mentioned in the goal above, we conducted a comprehensive review of all agency rules in
Fiscal Year 1998 to eliminate, consolidate, and/or revise those rules that are no longer in the
public interest.  During FY 1999, the FCC released 9 orders and 1 policy statement regarding
subjects potentially no longer necessary to the public interest.  Specific steps taken included:
   In March 1999,  we adopted an order streamlining the Section 214 authorization process;
 In May 1999, we adopted an order substantially revising and, in some cases, eliminating
          the International Settlements Policy.
 In June 1999, we adopted an order revising the settlement rate benchmark for facilities-
          based service on affiliated foreign routes.
  We also made fundamental changes to broadcast application and licensing procedures.
          These changes simplify, streamline, and  make more customer- friendly our rules,
          applications, and application procedures.
 In August 1999, we concluded our review of various ownership  rules, and modified  the
          Local TV “duopoly” restrictions and its local radio/TV cross-ownership restriction, as
          well as its national television ownership rule.  The FCC is currently considering
         additional changes to its ownership rules to conform to the current  marketplace as an
         additional implementation of the 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review.Performance was measured by a
determination that the 1998 Biennial
Regulatory Review was completed and by a
review of other actions taken during FY
1999 that further reduced rules that were
determined to no longer serve the public
interest.6We will complete relocation of the
FCC into a consolidated facility.Yes Relocation into a consolidated facility was successfully completed in May 1999. Performance was measured by the
completion of the relocation.
We will coordinate network
disclosure reporting requirements
under Section 251 and 273 of the
Communications Act to avoid any
duplicate or redundant disclosure
regulationsYes Section 251 network disclosures are placed on public notice typically within one week of
receipt.  The public notice indicates only that parties seeking information should visit the web
site. There have been no recorded complaints of this procedure or its overlapping with Section
273.Performance was measured by number of
complaints concerning overlap or
redundancy of network disclosure reporting
requirements under Section 251 and 273.
We will review the CCB Computer III
Court Remand to determine whether
any of the network disclosure rules
under Section 251(c)(5) duplicate or
even exceed the rules established
under the Computer II and Computer
III decisionsYes We eliminated the Computer III network disclosure rules in the Computer III Remand Order
issued in July 1999.Performance was measured by completion
of the Computer III Court Remand and any
changes made to network disclosure rules.
We will privatize the International
Telecommunications Settlements
(ITS) process.Yes We adopted an order ending our role as the maritime accounting authority in July 1999. Performance was measured by completion
of actions needed to privatize the
International Telecommunications
Settlements process.
We will determine whether
privatization of the electronic filing
functions lowers costs to the public
and improves their access to tariff
filings.No The FCC implemented an electronic tariff filing system (EFTS) that permits incumbent local
exchange carriers to submit federal tariffs and associated documents via the Internet.  Other
parties participating in tariff proceedings may also file tariff-related documents using ETFS.
ETFS also enables interested parties to access and download these documents over the Internet.
Due to limited resources devoted to Y2K related issues, the Bureau did not complete a
comprehensive review to determine whether the privatization of the electronic filing function
would be beneficial to our customers.Performance was measured by completion
of a determination of whether privatization
of the electronic filing functions lowers
costs to the public and improves their
access to tariff filings.
We will continue to hold public for a
and meet with our state regulatory
partners and consumer groups to
solicit input and feedback to ensure
our rules are in the public interest and
are the least burdensome to achieve
stated goalsYes During FY 1999, we conducted a number of important meetings and fora.  Chief among these
was the three public meetings held in May and June to discuss the FCC’s Draft Strategic Plan.
Members of the telecommunications industry (May 20), state and local government (June 2),
and academic and organizational experts (June 11) participated in- person and via the Internet.
The transcripts of each of these meetings were published at our website.  We continued to meet
with state regulatory partners and consumer groups and held a number of public fora.  Monthly
meetings were held with the North American Numbering Council and FCC representatives
attended every meeting of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commission.  FCC
staff attended a number of meetings in preparation for the upcoming World
Radiocommunications Conference. Staff attended bimonthly meetings with the Local and State
Government Advisory Committee. Finally, public fora were held to discuss a variety of issues
including implementation of Telecommunications Relay Services, proposals for streamlining
Part 68 terminal equipment registration, industry views on cable landing license policy and
procedures, and seminars on political programming rules.Performance was measured by a review of
the meetings and fora held during the fiscal
year.7Functional Area : Policy and Rulemaking
Objective: #2 We will encourage competition in the telecommunications industry through pro-competitive,
deregulatory rulemakings, reducing consumer costs and increasing the telecommunications choices available to
consumers.

administer carrier identification codes.9We will refine existing rules
concerning caller ID to respond to
consumer concerns about services that
use calling party numbers.Yes The FCC received very few calls concerning caller ID and currently has only two Petitions for
Reconsideration and one Petition for Review.  Consumer concerns are now handled as informal
complaints and additional refining of the existing rules appears to be unnecessary at this time.Performance was measured by a review of
consumer concerns received on this issue
and a determination of  the need for rule
changes.
We will establish procedures for
certification of rural carriers for
purposes of universal service high
cost support.No The FCC concluded in the Universal Service First Report and Order that reform of high-cost
support for rural carriers should not occur until January 1, 2001, at the earliest, and only after
recommendations have been received from the Joint Board, and a Rural Task Force appointed
by the Joint Board.Performance was measured by a review of

revised.  In FY 1999, we will initiate
rulemakings to eliminate obsolete or
overlapping regulatory and/or
reporting requirements.Yes The FCC conducted an agency-wide biennial review in 1998.  Based on this review, we took
the following actions in 1999:
• In common carrier issues, we released 9 orders and 1 policy statement addressing  matters
that were identified as no longer necessary:
• We made fundamental changes to the broadcast application and licensing procedures.
These changes simplify, streamline, and make our rules, application procedures, and
reporting forms more user friendly.  We also updated and streamlined our broadcast rules
and modified the local TV “duopoly” restrictions and our local radio/TV cross-ownership
rules.
• The FCC made significant progress in streamlining our procedures for satellite and other
international application processing issues.   We issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
recommending streamlining and consolidating service rules governing the Direct Satellite
Broadcast (DBS) service to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative regulation, increase
competition to the cable television industry, and facilitate the delivery of new and
innovative services to consumers. We adopted an order streamlining the Section 214
authorization process that will allow 99 percent of all applications to be processed in
fourteen days.  We adopted an order substantially revising and, in some cases, eliminating
the International Settlements Policy. We announced that we will automatically grant
routine satellite earth station applications proposing use of the Ku-band and
communicating with all satellites authorized to provide service to the U.S. within 35 days
from the date of the public notice (provided no objections have been filed). Finally, we
released an order substantially revising the settlement rate benchmark condition for
facilities-based service on affiliated foreign routes.
• The FCC completed its comprehensive streamlining of wireless licensing rules in the
Universal Licensing System rulemaking, Issuing a Memorandum Opinion and Order in
June 1999.  We also initiated a rulemaking focusing on streamlining of its Part 90 rules for

We will increase the number of
pending routine informal common
carrier complaints disposed of by
10%.No We encountered formidable technical problems with our automated informal complaints
system. The most important issue was the system was not Y2K compliant.  To upgrade it to
make it compliant required substantial resources,  raising issues on whether the current system
should be revised or completely replaced.  A thorough review of alternative approaches was
not completed until late in the fiscal year.  Currently, we are making every effort to upgrade the
system as quickly as possible.  In the meantime, we have hired additional temporary clerks to
assist us in processing current complaints as expeditiously as possible.Performance was measured through an

matters, met with pending applicants in the second Ka-band processing round to discuss
potential technical solutions for resolving mutual exclusivity, held a forum with industry
representatives on streamlining issues, including demonstrations to inform industry on
electronic filing and ULS, hosted a public forum on technical issues associated with E911
technology, including TTY compatibility, and provided training to the public on use of the new
experimental licensing and  IBFS electronic filing systems prior to their implementation.  A
public forum was conducted for every auction event.   The FCC also continuously updates its
website to include the latest information of interest to the public.Performance was measured by a review of
the number of public appearances by FCC
staff and comments to the FCC website.20Program Evaluations .  In Fiscal Year 1999 the FCC completed a number of agency-wide reviews. These included
• Consolidation of our Enforcement and Consumer Information Activities . The FCC is currently structured along the traditional technology lines of wire, wireless,
satellite, broadcast, and cable communications. This organizational model no longer reflects the industries we oversee.  We have determined that the FCC must reorganize
along functional rather than technology lines to allow us to perform our core responsibilities more effectively.  One of our major performance goals for our Fiscal Year
Annual Performance Plan was to complete work on consolidating our consumer information and enforcement functions. Our enforcement activities were distributed among
all our major bureaus while our consumer information services activities were more centrally located between two organizations.
Before we could consolidate these activities, we had to review the current resources, including staffing and information technology support systems to identify what the new
business model should include and to determine the best means to proceed with the consolidation.  Extensive reviews were conducted throughout the fiscal year and a
reorganization plan was completed that was implemented on November 11, 1999.
• Year 2000 Readiness Review .  The FCC conducted independent testing of all twenty-three mission-critical systems to verify that the systems were ready for the
millennium. The system tests were conducted by an independent contractor and tested on separate test hardware.  In addition, our Computer Security Office successfully
completed assessments of all our new major applications designed for use within the FCC network.  Eight application reviews were conducted to ensure compliance with
relevant OMB guidance on computer-based system development and management, including OMB Circular A-123, Management Accountability and Control, OMB
Circular A-27, Financial Management Systems, and OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources.
• Revisions to our Strategic Plan and Strategic Planning Process .  In March and May 1999, Chairman William Kennard, along with the other FCC Commissioners,
testified before our Congressional oversight committees.  As part of his testimony Chairman Kennard submitted a draft report, “A New FCC for the 21st Century.”  This
report served as a conceptual framework for FCC senior managers to meet and develop a new framework for our Strategic Plan.  Part of this process was a review of all our
organizations and functions to ascertain if they were still essential to the agency’s newly defined core functions.
We also gathered extensive input from our stakeholders through three public fora seeking the views of general industry, consumer, state, and local government
representatives, academic and organizational experts, and from Commission staff.  The feedback provided at these fora focused on similar themes: (1) universal service,
consumer protection and information; (2) enforcement and promotion of competitive markets domestically and worldwide; and (3) spectrum management.  We incorporated
many of these themes into the draft Strategic Plan that we submitted to Congress in August 1999 and in our draft Annual Performance Plan.
• Business Process Re-Engineering/Electronic Filing Initiatives .  In Fiscal Year 1999, the FCC completed planning for consolidating, streamlining and providing
electronic filing capabilities for all major Mass Media Bureau licensing systems.  Before design work could begin, a complete analysis of workload processes was
completed to identify outdated, duplicative, or unnecessary processes and procedures.  While all planning work was completed, system implementation was deferred due to
lack of adequate funding and the need to address higher priority, Year-2000 issues.

Mr. Latta.   Good morning.  The subcommittee will come to order.  And the 
chair recognizes himself for an opening statement.  
Good morning and welcome to today's oversight hearing of the Federal 
Communications Commission.  This is the third time we have had the FCC before us this 
Congress and I am pleased that we are maintaining a cadence of consistent oversight hearings.   
I want to first by starting -- again to once again offer our condolences to the 
chairwoman for the loss and passing of your father.  We hope that your memories of him have helped you cope during this very difficult time.  And although we can disagree on policy, we can come together to share each others' grief.  So on behalf of the committee we are very sorry on his passing.  
The last time the FCC was before us we discussed its role in President Biden's 
broadband takeover and its overregulation of the communications industry.  
Unfortunately, the agency has continued down this path.   
Earlier this year the FCC voted to reclassify broadband as a common carrier under 
Title II of the Communications Act under the guise of net neutrality.  This action expands 
the FCC's authority over broadband along agency to impose burdensome regulations that 
will make it harder for proprietors to deploy broadband.   
As I stated before, this action is absolutely unnecessary.  In 2017, after the FCC 
reversed the Obama FCC's re -classification of broadband, the Democrats told the world 
that we would get the internet one  word at a time and that the internet as we knew it 
would end.  As we all know, none of these fears came true.  In fact, the day after the order was going in on rescinding it, I asked my office to keep track of how many of my This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

4 
 constituents called in after the repeal to say they have lost their internet and I received 
zero calls.   
Instead, broadband networks thrived because of increased investment by private 
companies that has led to higher speeds and lower prices.  Indeed our networks survived the automa test when they withstood increased usage as a result of COVID- 19 
pandemic when almost every aspect of everyday life went online.  Contrast what happened in the United States to what happened in Europe where regulators had to ask websites like YouTube and Netflix to throttle and degrade services to withstand the 
increased demand.   
At our last hearing, the chairwoman attributed our successes to States enacting 
their own net neutrality policies, that couldn't be further from the truth.  The internet 
continued to function normally between the repeal and the States enacting their own 
laws.  Only a few States enacted and none enacted anything close to utility -style 
regulations that the FCC repealed and is now reimposing.  The true source of success for 
our networks is the light -touch regulatory framework that the FCC just moved away from.  
This action is just one of the many taken by the FCC to hinder U.S. leadership and 
technology.  The affect of these decisions is that deploying broadband and providing service will be more challenging for providers.   
These actions could not come at a worse time, Congress has provided $42.5  billion 
to close the digital divide to the Commission is undermining that effort by imposing 
regulations that will make it more expensive and more burdensome to deploy.  They 
should be doing the opposite.  I urge the FCC to reverse course and restore the light -touch regulatory environment that allowed broadband investment to thrive.   
I have many questions about the direction the Commission is taking.  I thank the This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 commissioners for being here today and I look forward to discussing this and these other 
very important questions that will before the Commission.   
And I will yield back the balance of my time.  I now recognize the ranking 
member of the subcommittee, my colleague, the gentlelady from California's Seventh District for an opening statement.

Ms. Matsui.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
And Madam Chairwoman, I too often my deepest condolences upon your loss.   
Today's hearing comes at a critical moment as the FCC must tackle challenges with 
far reaching impacts on U.S. consumers and competitiveness.  I am glad that this FCC 
has taken needed steps to expand broadband connectivity, deliver on net neutrality and strengthen cybersecurity among other urgent priorities.  I am especially excited about the FCC's recently announced cybersecurity pilot program for schools and libraries.   
Cyber attacks on our schools are only growing in frequency and sophistication.  
From 2016 to 2022 alone our K -12 schools suffered over 1,600 cyber attacks.  According 
to the GAO, every cyber attack at high schools districts cost tens of thousands and even up to millions of dollars.  That is why I introduced Enhancing K -12 Cybersecurity Act to 
improve school access to cybersecurity resources and nationwide tracking of K -12 cyber 
attacks.   
That is also why I have long urged the FCC to modernize cyber tools for schools by 
adopting a pilot program.  The FCC has taken a positive step toward improving K -12 
cybersecurity and I look forward to continuing to work with you on this issue.  
Whether this is cybersecurity or other challenges, we know we have more work 
ahead of us.  As a subcommittee we should be building up the FCC's ability to protect consumers and oversee our networks.  The stakes are simply too high for Congress to 
undermine the FCC's progress.  That is why this subcommittee and Congress must push 
forward on the unfinished work before us and fully empower the FCC to do its job.   
First, millions of American families are counting on Congress to keep them 
connected.  Yet as of last month, the Affordable Connectivity Program ran out of funds.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
7 
 That means more than 23 million households nationwide have lost the support they need 
to access affordable, high- quality broadband.   
The end of the ACP puts our low- income families at risk.  According to an FCC 
survey over two -thirds of ACP households reported having inconsistent or zero 
connectivity before ACP.  We can't afford to take a leap backwards and request to close the digital divide.  That is why I and more than half of the House support the ACP Extension Act.  Similarly, we can't afford to leave unsecured Chinese gear in our communications networks.  Congress must resolve the funding shortfall for the Rip and 
Replace Program to ensure we can remove every piece of vulnerable equipment from 
American networks.   
Earlier this month, the FCC reported that nearly 40  percent of Rip and Replace 
funding with recipients said they can't finish replacement work without full funding for the program.  These providers are at risk of shutting down their networks or withdrawing from the Rip and Replace Program.  This is unacceptable.  We must act to 
curb this risk to our consumers and national security.  I am committed to keeping ACP 
and Rip and Replace funded.  Let's work together to ensure these critical bipartisan programs do not fall by the wayside.  
And finally, I want to briefly discuss another urgent matter, renewing the FCC's 
spectrum option authority.  I know I am not the only member of the subcommittee frustrated by how more than a year later the FCC is still ham stringed in its ability to drive 
innovation through a healthy spectrum pipeline.  At a time when the FCC is renewing 
focus on 6G and other innovative technologies that rely on spectrum, we can't afford delay.  We need the FCC fully empowered with option authority and the Federal Government working to advance a unified U.S. spectrum position on the global stage.   This is an unedited transcript.

 With that, I want to thank the chairwoman and commissioners for appearing 
before us today and I yield the balance of my time.

Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady yields back.  The chair now recognizes 
for 5  minutes the ranking member --  the chair of the full committee.  
The Chair.   I would be the chair.  I am still the chair.  
Mr. Latta.   No, I am sorry.  I was just thinking that I have to recognize the 
gentlelady from Michigan because the ranking member is not here.  Sorry about that.  
But the chair of the full committee, the gentlelady from Washington for 5  minutes.  
The Chair.   Good morning thank you Chairman Latta, chairwomen, 
commissioners welcome back.  Bridging the digital divide is one of this committee's top priorities and it is the FTC's statutory responsibility to assist us in that effort.  But unfortunately, the FCC has been failing in its mission.  The commission's recent action to reclassify broadband internet access as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act, as well as the agency's broad rules on digital discrimination have undermined our efforts to ensure every American has access to broadband.   
This could not come at a worse time.  We are on the verge of closing the digital 
divide.  Congress has dedicated billions of dollars to achieve this effort, including $42 billion for the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program at the National Telecommunications and Information Agency.  Those efforts are undercut when the Commission then places every handed regulations and micromanages providers, making it harder to encourage participation in these programs to deploy and operate new 
networks and get more people connected.   
As has already been proven once, Title II is a solution in search of a problem.  It is 
a century -old framework designed it address telephone monopolies, whereas today's 
broadband marketplace is incredibly competitive.  These regulations will hurt This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 consumers most, resulting in higher prices and slower internet speeds.   
The FCC has failed to learn from previous efforts and has no legitimate jurisdiction 
for these heavy handed regulations.   
The talking points that these regulations protect consumers from harmful ISP 
practices are not rooted in fact and have already been disproven once by the incredible 
performance of our networks, especially in the wake of the COVID -19 pandemic.   
The facts are that speeds are up, investment and broadband networks is up, and 
prices for consumers are down.  The fast lanes blocking and throttling the traffic that 
Democrats warned about never transpired.  Our light -touch regulatory environment 
works.  And turning away from this success with unnecessary regulations is wrongful 
action.   
Reclassifying broadband under Title II is not only bad policy, it is also unlawful.  
As the Republicans on this committee and the Senate commerce committee wrote to the Commission before its decision.  The FCC has no authority to reclassify broadband.  
That is Congress' job, as the Supreme Court recently confirmed.   
The FCC doesn't get to just claim something is necessary for American national 
security in order to do whatever they want.  That is for Congress decide, as it has in 
numerous instances recently with things like our TikTok legislation establishing the Rip and Replace Program and passing the Secure Equipment Act.  The decision on how to regulate broadband can have significant economic and political consequences requires 
the FCC to have clear authorization from Congress in order to act.   
When it comes to Title II, we have given the Commission no such authority.  This 
is not the first time this FCC has exceeded their authority.  Last December the agency 
approved rules on data breach notification.  That mirrors the rule that Congress This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

11 
 disapproved of in 2017 through the Congressional Review Act procedures.  The CRA 
forbids the FCC from enacting rules that are substantially the same as those Congress 
rejected.  And now the FCC has circulated an order that would regulate the use of 
artificial intelligence in political ads.  A task that does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Commission which drew condemnation from the Federal Election Commission, the independent agency who does hold that authority.  This pattern of the FCC abusing its authority and ignoring congressional direction is just another example of the Biden administration's efforts to assert more Federal control over the American people's lives.  
This must end and I look forward to the courts stepping in to he overturn these unlawful 
power grabs.  This agency is pursuing a partisan agenda that ignores Congress and fails to solve the actual problems impacting Americans like illegal robocalls or permitting 
reform to help deploy broadband faster or additional ways to secure our networks from the threats posed by our adversaries.   
Today's hearing presents an opportunity to hold the FCC accountable for its 
actions.  I look forward it our discussion.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Mr. Latta.   Thank you very much.  The chair yields back the balance of her time.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Michigan's Sixth District for an 
opening statement for 5  minutes.  
Mrs. Dingell.   Thank you, Mr.  Chair.  I am giving the Ranking Member Pallone's 
opening statement today.   
We are here today conducting important oversight of the Federal 
Communications Commission and its budget for the upcoming year.  We commend the 
FCC under the leadership of chairwoman Rosenworcel for putting the American people at 
the heart of every decision it has made over the last 3  years.   
The FCC has consistently prioritized work to protect consumers, promote public 
safety and enhance national security in our communications sector, leading the way towards a digital future that is safe and secure for all Americans.  Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the FCC's adoption of a net neutrality protections.  This action 
corrected the Trump era FCC's misguided rollback of commonsense rules for an open 
internet.  We strongly support the reinstatement of this authority.  The agency rectified a massive dereliction of its duty and extended bedrock consumer protections to broadband internet access that our Nation has always applied to communication services.   
The FCC's actions will result in greater oversight over internet providers to 
mitigate network outages, resolve broadband consumer complaints, prevent 
anti-consumer and anti -competitive practices and protect our national security.  
The FCC is also playing a major role in the implementation of the broadband 
investments President Biden and congressional Democrats delivered as part of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  In May, the FCC released its fourth major update to the National This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 Broadband Map which serves as the backbone the historic $42 billion investment to bring 
high speed, affordable broadband to communities overlooked for too long.  Not one 
Republican on this subcommittee voted in favor of that bill and yet they continue to 
attack it and jeopardize its success at every opportunity.   
We are also likely to hear today attacks from Republican commissioners against 
the implementation of the BEAD program.  These attacks fail to recognize that this is the largest investment in broadband deployment in our Nation's history.  And we want to make sure that we get it right.  I would think we would all agree with that.  These 
attacks are only going to hurt communities throughout the entire Nation that have either 
been unserved or underserved for too long.   
As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we also created the Affordable 
Connectivity Program, which has made broadband more affordable for 23 million American families.  I commend the FCC for successfully implementing this program and working to get eligible families signed up.   
Unfortunately, House Republican leadership allowed the program to lapse last 
month, leaving all of these families with the very difficult decision of paying higher internet bills every month and many of them can't afford it, pure and simple, can't afford it or they lose the service all together.  Extending the popular Affordable Connectivity Program should be something that Democrats and Republicans can agree on.  After all, it benefits red and blue districts alike and I look forward someday to us going back to just 
being Americans, including rural, urban and suburban communities.   
I would also like to commend the chairwoman for recently proposing that any 
political ads containing content generated using artificial intelligence must disclose that 
fact.  This approached requirement will help viewers better understand how political This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 campaigns are attempting to influence them.   
We appreciate the chairwoman's efforts on the subject and will continue to 
support efforts to increase transparency around campaign ads and the use of AI finally.   
Finally, there is increasing concern about extreme and Republican efforts to 
destroy agencies like the FCC and the important role it plays on behalf of the public in 
overseeing critical services like our communication networks.  These Republican attacks against our Federal agencies would be devastating for consumers and would only help powerful companies to increase their profits even more.  Trump's Project 2025 plan, 
authored in part by a Republican commissioner before us today would exasperate these 
consumer harms by eliminating expert agencies, gutting the civil service and consolidating power under the President.  This will have serious negative consequences for 
Americans, leading to higher prices, lower quality services and decreased safety and security.  We simply cannot allow that to happen.  So I appreciate the FCC's work in protecting American consumers and I thank the commissioners for being here today.  
Since I have almost no time left, I yield back the balance of it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

COMMISSIONER, FCC; GEOFFREY STARKS, COMMISSIONER, FCC; NATHAN SIMINGTON, 
COMMISSIONER, FCC; AND ANNA GOMEZ, COMMISSIONER, FCC  
 STATEMENT OF JESSICA ROSENWORCEL  
 
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Chair Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you to discuss our budget effort, and effort to build a digital future that works for everyone.   
Since I appeared before you last year a lot has happened at the FCC.  Let me start 
with this, we won an Emmy.  The academy honored the FCC for its work repurposing broadcast airwaves for new wireless uses.  I am going to bet that makes us unique among agencies in Washington.  We are also unique because we get a lot done.   
So beyond the bright lights and red carpet let me tell you about it.  First, the FCC 
is working to connect everyone everywhere.  We built the Affordable Connectivity Program, the largest broadband affordability effort in our Nation's history, 23 million households rely on it, but funding expired in May and we need Congress to continue it.   
Second, the FCC is working to protect consumers and enhance competition.  In 
April we took steps to ensure that the Nation's expert communications authority has 
basic oversight over the most essential communications of our time by reinstating net 
neutrality because every consumer deserves internet access that a fast, open and fair.   
We introduced new broadband nutrition labels so consumers can compare service 
plans.  We launched the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark so consumers have confidence Internet This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 of Things devices.  And next week we are voting on a proposal to unlock wireless phones 
because you bought the phone, you should be able to use it with any carrier you choose.   
Third, the FCC created the National Broadband Map, this map is the most accurate 
data we have telling us where broadband is and is not.  We need funding for the Broadband DATA Act to continue because this map is how we ensure accountability for all new broadband spending.   
Fourth, the FCC is making connectivity more accessible.  Last year we kicked off a 
proceeding to make video conferencing services accessible to people with disabilities.  
We also improved wireless emergency alerts, making them available in more than a 
dozen languages.   
Fifth, the FCC is working to connect the most vulnerable.  We implemented the 
Safe Connections Act helping survivors of domestic violence get secure communications they need.  And we proposed to add a new missing and endangered persons code for emergency alerts so we can help save more lives, especially in Tribal communities.   
Sixth, the FCC is connecting families.  Next week we will vote to implement the 
Martha Wright -Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act which will significantly 
lower rates for phone calls for those who are incarcerated and their kin.   
Seventh, the FCC securing your communications.  For the first time in history we 
are have revoked the authorization to provide telecommunication services in the United States for four Chinese companies.  This action will soon include broadband and not just 
voice service.   
In May, we proposed plans to mitigate internet routing vulnerabilities identified 
by DOJ, DHS and DOD.  On top of this, we continue to work to remove Huawei and ZTE 
equipment in our networks.  But without more funding, carriers may not be able to This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 complete the process, threatening national security and risking the shut down of rural 
networks.   
Eighth, the FCC is doubling down on efforts to stop scam robocalls and rotexts.  
We made clear that AI generated robocalls are illegal, issued hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and are now working with 49 State Attorneys General to get this junk off the line.  But we need more authority from Congress to keep these scam artists at bay.   
Ninth, the FCC is supporting the growing space economy.  There is been a huge 
increase in the number and complexity of applications for satellite services.  In response 
we created the Space Bureau, streamlined satellite processing, freed spectrum for 
commercial space launches and established a first of its kind in the world framework for the coming convergence of satellite and terrestrial services, we call it the single network 
future.   
And last but not least, the FCC is working to free up more spectrum for 5G, 6G and 
beyond.  But to do this, we need Congress to restore the agency's action authority.  For 
the first time in 3  decades we do not have it.  Restoring this authority will provide the 
United States with the strongest foundation to compete in a global economy, counter our 
adversaries technology ambitions and safeguard our national security.   
And using this authority we won and Emmy award, bring it back and let's see what 
we can do with it next.   
So those are some of things that the FCC is doing to build a digital future that 
works for everyone.  I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

Mr. Latta.   Well, thank you very much for your testimony.  
Commissioner Carr, you are recognized for 5 minutes for an opening statement.  
 
STATEMENT OF BRENDAN CARR   
 
Mr. Carr.   Thanks.  Chair Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to testify.  I want to start with the subject of 
today's hearing, the FCC's 2025 budget request.  As I detailed in testimony, I do not 
support the FCC's request for a nearly 15  percent increase in its budget.  This significant 
increase is out of line with agency precedent and out of step with the House's focus on reining in spending.   
More broadly, though, the FCC's request reflects the Biden administration's 
misplaced priorities and a massive regulatory overreach.  
One area where you can see this is the Biden administration's $42 billion internet 
infrastructure plan known as BEAD which puts partisan political goals ahead of smart policy.   
BEAD is the administration's signature plan for extending high speed internet to 
millions of Americans.  And it is a program that is going off the rails.  It has now been 967 days since President Biden signed his $42 billion plan into law.   
967 days later, not one person has been connected to the internet with those 
dollars, not even one shovel worth of dirt has been turned in those 967  days.  And it 
gets worse.  The administration says no construction projects will even start until next year at the earliest.  This makes President Biden's signature $42 billion initiative the This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 slowest moving broadband deployment program in recent history.   
The Biden administration's failure to launch is not only predictable it was 
predicted.  Members of Congress 2  years ago wrote the administration and explained 
that its own decisions would create a complex, nine step, iterative structure review 
process that is likely to mire the program in excessive bureaucracy and delay connecting Americans.  A year later members again explain that the administration's rules divert resources away from bringing broadband service to rural America.   
So what has the Biden administration been doing in those 967  days instead of 
connecting Americans?  It has been layering on red tape in advancing a wish list of progressive policy goals.  The administration is using this program to pursue a climate change agenda, DEI requirements, technology biases, price controls and preferences for 
government -run networks.   
None of this has do with quickly connecting Americans.  And it is not to say that 
there aren't broadband bills underway today with dollars the Biden administration has 
made available, but those other initiatives have their own sets of problems from lack of 
coordination to spending dollars on the penny.   
One example, in 2020 the FCC secured a commitment from Starlink to provide 
high speed internet to over 640,000 locations for about $1,300 per location in Federal support, but the government revoked that award in 2022.  The Biden administration is now spending orders of magnitude more in Federal taxpayer dollars to connect locations 
through its own initiatives.   
The administration's $42 billion BEAD initiative isn't the only instance of regulatory 
overreach that merits this subcommittee's attention.  There are growing set of FCC 
decisions that plainly deviate from the laws that you hear in Congress have passed.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 The Supreme Court's decision in Loper Bright only underscores the need for the 
FCC to change course in a very fundamental way.  That should start with the FCC 
abandoning its unlawful plan to regulate political speech on the eve of a national election.   
This effort which echoes a DNC -backed initiative at the FEC would impose new 
regulations on AI -generated political speech, just before voters hit the ballot boxes this 
fall.  I oppose it.   
The FCC should also withdraw its decision to vote on a WiFi hotspot order, as well 
as its proposal to regulate bulk billing, which could only raise prices for Americans that live in apartments, condos and public housing.  At bottom, the FCC needs to get back to 
our core mission, closing the digital divide.  That means freeing up spectrum in modernizing our infrastructure rules.  It is time to correct course.   
In closing, I want to thank you again for the opportunity to testify.  I look forward 
your questions.

Mr. Latta.   Thank you very much.  
Mr. Starks, you are recognized for 5  minutes.   
Mr. Starks.   Thank you, Chairman Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, members of 
the subcommittee.  Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you here today.   
One of my highest priorities as a commissioner has been to connect all Americans 
everywhere to high -quality broadband regardless of where they live or how much money 
that they make.  And on this front I cannot overstate the importance of the Affordable 
Connectivity Program for the over 23 American households that relied on this program it 
offered them a critical opportunity to get and stay connected.  
I think about Paul, a senior that I met in Illinois in February, he told me that his 
internet connection was  "like air."  And that is the reality of how vital broadband is to 
Americans today.   
I think about Ron, a veteran who utilized his internet connection to contact the VA 
hospitals to set up medical appointment, more importantly to attend virtual meetings where he said he could share his experience with PTSD to help empower other veterans like himself.   
I think about my visit to Fort Wayne, Indiana and about the families that I heard 
from there who relied on ACP to keep their children from falling behind in school.  I 
remember my friend Debra who asked me if she was going to have to eat less food when 
ACP went away because she would still need the internet.  It was letter link to her family 
and to her church that was otherwise many hours away.  Seniors, veterans, vulnerable families in rural areas, Tribal lands, urban spaces and everything in between, these are the stories of ACP and people that I know.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
23 
 So let me be clear.  ACP is the most effective program we have had in helping 
low-income Americans get online and stay connected.  In fact in my opinion, it's been 
the most successful program ever and our decade's long bipartisan effort to solve the 
digital divide.   
We have made real progress in closing that digital device through ACP and he can 
we cannot afford to let it slide backwards.  And so I look forward to working with those of you on this committee as you reconsider funding this critical program.  Making sure that broadband is affordable is just 1  piece of puzzle.   
We also need to make sure that it was safe and secure so in April we reclassified 
broadband internet access  under Title II of the Communications Act, a service that vitally 
needs oversight.   
I remain concerned as well about the threats to our Nation's networks, but I am 
confident that the FCC's recent bipartisan actions will help protect them.  Just last month the Commission unanimously approved a proposal to require ISPs to adopt 
security risk management plans for their use of border gateway protocol and this will help 
Americans' data and make sure it is securely and accurately routed.  In addition, we must prioritize fully funding our Rip and Replace Program.   
We have made great progress here, but additional funding is absolutely needed to 
complete the removal replacement and destruction of insecure Chinese equipment and services from our communication networks.  Without this funding, providers in rural 
America, including those that support our military installations, are perilously close to 
being shut down.   
While participating in the Rip and Replace Program they cannot update or 
maintain their legacy networks and they need our help.  Network threats including from This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 state actors like Russia and China are not hypothetical.  America's ability to lead both 
abroad and here at home relies on an extension of the FCC's spectrum action authority.   
And restoring that authority will provide the United States with the strongest 
foundation to compete in a global economy, Tribe growth and investment, enhance competition and ensure national security.   
One of the most visible ways we promote safety and security comes by the FCC 
supporting and improving our emergency alert system today.  We are of course watching Hurricane Beryl storm through Texas and Arkansas.  We have also seen historic 
flooding in the Midwest.  I was in Midwest a few weeks ago and saw flooding in South 
Dakota, saw flooding in Iowa.   
It is essential that Americans receive, understand and act upon an emergency 
immediately.  And that is why we are requiring wireless providers to support alerts in over a dozen languages.  
One of the agency's chief missions is also protecting consumers.  The Cyber Trust 
Mark a great advancement here, as well as the junk fee initiatives that the agency has undertaken.   
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss these and more.  I look forward to your 
questions.

Mr. Latta.   Thank you for your testimony.  
And commissioner Simington you are recognized for 5  minutes for your opening 
statement.  
 
STATEMENT OF NATHAN SIMINGTON   
 
Mr. Simington.   Thank you.  Chairman Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, and 
distinguished members of the subcommittee it is a privilege to appear before you today.   
Today I would like to address what I believe is one of the most pressing priorities 
for the Commission, securing wireless and Internet of Things devices in the face of the 
accelerating move from a single internet and technology market were fragmented along national borders due to concerns about digital sovereignty, specifically threats to the United States from China.  Device security and technology evolution implicates all of the 
commission's core functions at a basic level, most specifically its authority over 
commercial spectrum.   
However, before I highlight these concerns, I must again express my frustration 
with the direction that the Commission has taken in dedicating its limited resources to implementation of partisan unnecessary and burdensome policy frameworks like the Title II broadband and digital discrimination regulatory regimes.  These heavy handed 
priorities leave little room for common sense urgently needed reforms and soak up 
invaluable commission attention.  Such reforms include not only a comprehensive framework for securing our networks with threats which I will address in detail, but also a 
universal service fund contribution's overhaul and it continued focus on space leadership.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
26 
 But now to device security, there was a lot of idealism in the early days of the 
internet.  There was the universal open network where people from around the world 
could exchange services and ideas basically without restrictions.  There were no borders 
online.  If you put up a website in the United States, someone in any other country could access it just a well, perhaps a bit more slowly, but it acts just as well as someone in the United States.  Across the world people were using the same devices, running the same software, usually with no modification and a local translation of the user interface.  But today we have seen that there is potential for foreign technology devices and services to 
be vehicle for espionage and sabotage.  We really cannot be sure that any non trivial 
device from China, be it a network router, a laptop, a cell phone can be trusted to not contain backdoors that would allow the Chinese government to exfiltrate data, take 
control of the device or render it inoperative.  But those same concerns must ultimately extend to any services that store data about Americans in adversary countries or countries and companies that could easily come under the influence of those adversaries.   
Even the most seemingly benign use of foreign technology can become a security 
threat.  GPS developed and controlled by the U.S. military was once the only satellite -based global positioning and precision timing system in the world.  But now it 
faces competition from foreign alternatives like the EU's Galileo, Russia’s Glonass and China's BeiDou.  Supporting those systems there are sometimes a requirement for device manufacturers wishing to sell in those countries.   
So between achieving economies of scale from manufacturers in all markets and 
the fact that these positioning systems currently offer higher precision in some cases than the American GPS system.  It appears that many American businesses and consumers are knowingly or unknowingly relying on these foreign systems.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
27 
 And what is worse, American businesses and consumers often make the decision 
most likely unknowingly to buy untrustworthy equipment from a Chinese or other foreign 
company because the equipment is inexpensive or preselected by a preferred and trusted 
vendor.   
Unfortunately most of these products come from companies that fail to take 
security seriously and that are careless in their software development practices.  How many of these routinely failed to correct known security vulnerabilities in a timely manner and many of don't even take the most basis precautions to prevent unauthorized 
access and control of the now millions of wireless IoT devices they make available to 
American consumers and businesses.   
Given all of these increasingly burgeoning threats, I am very pleased that in March 
of this year my Commission colleagues were willing to reach across the aisle and work diligently alongside me to put teeth into the commission's implementation of the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark program.  This voluntary program sets a high bar for the security of 
wireless devices.   
If manufacturers want to be eligible for the mark, they will have to declare that 
they have taken every reasonable measure to create a secure device.  They will have to 
commit to support period up front.  During that support period they will have to diligently identify critical vulnerabilities in their products and promptly release updates correcting them.  I look forward to continuing to work with colleagues to figure out how 
to expand this program to computers, smartphones, routers and other devices.   
My commission colleagues also agreed to include a further notice of proposed 
rulemaking on the issue of how to handle devices that were software developed in hostile 
countries that will receive updates deployed from or that can be controlled by servers in This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 such countries or that will store user data in those countries.  Such devices at high risk of 
being weaponized by hostile powers like China.  And as a result, there is still so much 
more work to be done to protect the American public.  
Chairman Latta, vice chair Carter, Ranking Member Matsui and members of the

Mr. Latta.   Thank you for your testimony.

STATEMENT OF ANNA GOMEZ   
 
Ms. Gomez.   Thank you.  Good morning, Chair Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, 
and members of the subcommittee.  It is an honor to appear before you today.   
In the past 9  months, I have had the privilege of traveling across the country to 
meet with consumers, industry leaders, advocacy groups and local elected officials 
figures.  These meetings highlighted the importance of communication services in daily life and the FCC's mission to ensure these services are accessible to everyone.   
We know that high speed internet service is no longer a luxury but a necessity.  
During a visit to the Orlando Veterans' Affairs Medical Center I learned that 80  percent of 
medical treatments veterans use for recovery required a broadband connection.  A veteran from Paralyzed Veterans of America told me that connectivity is essential for veterans, particularly veterans with disabilities to obtain healthcare, job opportunities and VA benefits.   
The importance of digital connectivity in the daily lives of Americans is what 
makes the funding lapse of the bipartisan Affordable Connectivity Program so concerning.  As of June  1 when funding lapsed, 23 million households across the United States lost 
support for the connectivity they need for work, school and healthcare.   
While some internet service providers have voluntarily stepped up to provide This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 limited free or lower cost service, these are temporary salves.  And absence action 
families will face rising bills and disconnections.  I very much empathize because I have 
lived experience with having to choose between paying rent and paying my phone bill.  
The ACP is e most successful tool Congress has ever provided to close the digital 
divide.  The ACP benefited every corner of the country and it connected communities 
historically on the wrong side of the digital divide.  The end of this program threatens the significant progress.  And I worry that we risk failing to maximize the billions in bipartisan investment in broadband infrastructure.   
Beyond connectivity, I would like to highlight a few noteworthy consumer -focused 
actions that the Commission has taken recently.  We now require that wireless emergency alerts reach consumers in 13 languages and American Sign Language.  This 
will help save lives.   
We also proposed to establish a new emergency alert code dedicated to help find 
missing adults that would not be reported though existing alerts.  This can bring comfort 
to families by helping to find missing loved ones and to address the crisis of missing and 
murdered indigenous persons, a topic I discussed with the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe recently.   
We have also implemented Congress's direction the Safe Connections Act by 
requiring mobile phone providers to separate the line of a domestic abuse survivor from that of their abuser.  And we continue to tax actions to address unwanted robocalls and 
robotexts.  And the Commission reinstated rules to protect the open internet.  
Broadband internet access is too important, too essential to the safety, economy, health, education and well- being of this country not to have guardrails in place.   
From robocalls to spectrum licenses much of our work domestically is tied to our This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 work internationally.  As commissioner I have met with multiple counterparts around 
the world.  From these engagements it is clear that the thirst for wireless innovation is 
global.  With have been global leaders in wireless innovation and made spectrum 
options the gold standard for assigning this finite resource.  We must continue to foster innovation to meet our wireless needs and that requires congressional action to reestablish the FCC's action authority.   
The conversations I have had over the last 9  months have given me a greater 
appreciation for the critical role the Commission plays in the lives of Americans.  I want 
to read you a message I received from a young mother.  I am writing to you as a mother 
of two that really depends on having internet on the ACP to be able to work, to find work and to educate them.  I know it is asking a lot for you to consider keeping this try to find 
funding for it.  I don't have much to my name.   
Everything I have is negative standings right now.  If you can manage to find a 
way or maybe change somebody's mind so that the funding doesn't end.  When I think 
about the mission of FCC, I think about what is at stake for Americans like this young 
mother.  There remains much work to do.  And I am honored to have the opportunity to serve the people of the United States.   
I look forward to collaborating with you, Federal partners, State, local and Tribal 
leaders and all stakeholders as I continue my service.  
Thank you.

Mr. Latta.   And thank you very much for your statement.  That will conclude our 
opening statements from our five commissioners.   
And we will now begin questioning and I recognize myself for 5  minutes.  I would 
like to ask unanimous consent for a point of personal privilege to recognize the former 
chair of full committee, Mr.  Walden.  Good having you back.  We never forget you.  
Commissioner Carr, this Democratic commission has unfortunately voted to once 
again reclassify broadband under Title II.  Chairman Rosenworcel claims that the 
internet did not break when Title II was repealed in 2017 because States stepped in to 
enact their own net neutrality rules.  That broadband coverage has been expanded, it's fees have increased and costs have decreased throughout the United States, not just in the States that enacted net neutrality rules.  What is your response to this claim?   
Mr. Carr.   Well, the presence of those State laws is not the reason why we didn't 
see all of the predictions from 2017 come true.  For one, the State laws didn't take 
effect for a number of years.  For another, if the potential of State regulation was 
enough then that undermines the need for the FCC to step in with heavy handed rules.  The reality is is we yes told that repealing these rules in 2017 would be the end of internet as we know it.  Since then, speeds are up over fivefold, prices are down in real terms, millions of Americans were brought across digital divide and COVID -19 was the 
ultimate stress test with our right regulatory framework or network performed.   
Whereas those in Europe, which had heavier handed utility style regulation saw 
speed slowdowns quite dramatically.  In fact, their regulators asked Netflix and YouTube to degrade the quality of the streams to prevent the continent's networks from breaking.  So this was ultimately a solution in search of a problem that didn't exist.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
33 
 Mr. Latta.   Last meeting that we had, I asked you whether the FCC chair provided 
any briefings to discuss the disclosing the national security threat needed to be addressed 
by Title II.  You said no.  Did you receive any such briefings before the April vote?   
Mr. Carr.   I have had SCIF level briefings.  None of them involved either the FBI 
or the CIA or National Security Agency, just internal officials in the FCC.  There is nothing 
that I have seen in those SCIF level briefings that indicate that Title II was necessary to address any national security threat.  In fact, if you look right now reports are that Commerce Department is using existing authorities, part 7 authorities to look at potential 
issues involving potentially China Mobile, China Telecom if the reports are true.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  
I will continue.  While the FCC is expanding its authority and opposing heavy 
handed regulations in the broadband industry, other Federal agencies are about to 
provide tens of billions of dollars to connect all Americans.  How would a reclassification as Title II service and the FCC's digital discrimination rules effect the success of these 
other Federal programs in our efforts to close the digital divide?   
Mr. Carr.   This regulatory onslaught from Washington is simply increasing the 
cost artificially of American's broadband builders that are trying to bridge the digital 
divide.  It is a headwind, not a tailwind.  How do we know this?  At the very last second in our digital equity proceeding, the Biden administration secured an exemption for its own signature $42 billion BEAD program, which I take as evidence that those heavy 
handed regulations are going to get harder for broadband initiatives to succeed.  
Mr. Latta.   Well, is this the right time to impose these regulations?  
Mr. Carr.   I am sorry?  
Mr. Latta.   Is this the right time to impose these regulations?  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
34 
 Mr. Carr.   Right now broadband builders are seeing a massive spike in their costs, 
everything from supply chain issues to just purchasing pickup trucks to do the actual 
building.  And so right now we need to be focused on eliminating artificial costs, that 
means streamlining permitting which we are not doing, that means pushing more spectrum out there that we are not doing.  That this regulatory onslaught from Washington is only just further increasing costs in an already inflationary environments.  So we are a headwind right to these efforts.  
Mr. Latta.   Well, commissioner Simington, do you agree with that?  
Mr. Simington.   Yes.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.   
I am part of a bipartisan, bicameral universal service working group that is looking 
to reform the USF so the programs and funding reflect our country's needs moving forward.   
Commissioner Carr, what reforms do you think Congress needs to make to the USF 
into the programs it supports?   
Mr. Carr.   Well, thanks chairman for your leadership on this.  You know, when it 
comes to universal service, I am reminded of an old saying from President Reagan that the government oftentimes is like an infant, an insatiable appetite on one end and no sense of responsibility on the other.  Right now the FCC continues to expand our U.S. definition in an unlawful way, in my view including a vote later this month to fund 
hotspots from schools and libraries.   
So the first thing we need to do is stick with the statutory terms and not expand 
the universal service program right now without taking on any responsibility for the fact 
that the cost of this is being born by the monthly bills of Americans, that cost keeps going This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 up and up.  And so I want to commend you for your work.   
Again the FCC should stop expanding it and we should take a hard look at how we 
can put this program on firmer, sounder financial footing.  
Mr. Latta.   Well, thank you.  
My time has expired and I yield back.  The chair recognizes the ranking member 
of the subcommittee the gentlelady from California for 5  minutes for questions.  
Ms. Matsui.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
America's leadership inspection policy fills just enough technological innovation 
and WiFi to satellite and advanced wireless networks.  However, the FCC spectrum 
option lapsed over a year ago.  Undermining America's ability to bring new spectrum to market and advance the spectrum policies in global negotiations.   
Commissioner Gomez, how is the continued lack of spectrum option authority 
impacting our international leadership and the ability of American companies to drive innovation?   
Mr. Gomez.   Thank you for that question, Ranking Member Matsui.  The lack of 
having our spectrum authority is absolutely putting us behind in terms of being able to advance our U.S. competitive as our global competitiveness in wireless innovation.   
For a variety of reasons not the least of which is we cannot currently auction 
spectrum, but we also can't plan for future auctions.  We need that authority in order to be able to take the many steps in advance of an auction in order to be able to initiate an 
auction.  It also effects our innovators and equipment manufacturing because they too 
need certainty to know how they should manufacture equipment, develop equipment based on services that we are going to be auctioning.  
Ms. Matsui.   Thank you.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
36 
 We talked about a far right connectivity program, the ACP, many times.  
Chairman Rosenworcel, ACP was a significant resource in addressing disparities and 
broadband access for undersevered communities.  With the program now expired, what 
efforts is the FCC taking to secure the progress made by ACP in closing the digital divide?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Thank you for the question.  The Affordable Connectivity 
Program was the largest program in our Nation's history to help close the digital divide by helping low- income households in every State in this country get online and stay online.   
We are proud of the work we did to get it up and running, now we want to sustain 
all of those opportunities to keep people connected.  Obviously the first thing we can do is have Congress continue to fund this program.  But apart from that we have done a lot of work to reach out to outreach partners to make sure that they are aware of alternatives and that they notify those they have been working with about what it means to stay connected.   
And we are monitoring complaints regarding the Affordable Connectivity Program.  
And I should add that we have seen a 40  percent increase from consumers on them 
because they are upset that this program has come to an end.  So if you can find a way to continue it, I think that is good for us.  
Ms. Matsui.   Thank you very much.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   -- digital divide.  
Ms. Matsui.   As original cosponsor of the Rip and Replace I believe allowing 
Huawei and other vulnerable equipment gear to continue operating in America networks was simple unacceptable.  But that is exactly what is happening today.  We made progress removing much of it, the ongoing funding shortfall means the job is far from over.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
37 
 Commissioner Starks did mention the ongoing national security, but what are the 
limitations that rule carriers face when maintaining or upgrading their networks without 
full Rip and Replace funding.  
Mr. Starks.   Yes, thank you for the question and your hard work and leadership 
here.  I have long said network security is national security.  With our providers 
receiving on $0.40 on the dollar, 14 out of 126 applicants have only completed their Rip and Replace work.  
Ms. Matsui.   Okay.  
Mr. Starks.   And so what that really means is that those that are near military 
installations we have vulnerabilities there, some of these are the only providers in rural areas so we absolutely need to finish the job.  
Ms. Matsui.   Okay.  Thank you.   
Robocalls, those are sort of bane of our existence, I think.  But predatory 
robocalls and texts threaten consumer privacy and financial well -being.  In 2022 alone 
the FTC reported more than $1.13 billion in financial losses to consumers from scam phone calls and texts.  That is why I introduced the Stop Scams and Spam Act to expose the worst illegal robocall and robotext campaign and why I introduced the FCC Legal Enforcement Act to further crack down on criminal robo callers.   
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, do you believe that increased transparency and 
enforcement as provided in my bills could help protect Americans from scam calls and 
texts.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yes, I do.  
Ms. Matsui.   Okay, great.  Let me just also ask about this too.  We talked 
about E -Rate many times.  The FCC is at the frontlines of efforts to close the digital This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 divide and programs that E -Rate played a crucial role by ensuring education, equity and 
empowering students with essential resources.   
Chairman Rosenworcel, this month the FCC plans to vote on the proposal to 
support WiFi hotspots for off premises use under the E -Rate program.  How would this 
change impact the digital divide and help close the home ward gap and you have got 
10 seconds.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, you probably remember from the pandemic kids and 
people sitting in parking lots and outside of schools just trying to get online.  This is an 
effort to help stop problems like that.  We have authority under the law to make it 
happen.  Every library should have wireless hotspots alone we should make that the baseline in the United States we should.  
Ms. Matsui.   Thank you very much.  
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady yields back the balance of her time.  And the chair 
now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia's First District for 5  minutes of questions.  
Mr. Carter.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And thank all of you for being here 
today, we appreciate your presence.   
Commissioner Carr, I want to ask you, I understand that the courts upheld the 
FCC's previous rules to streamline the broadband permitting process under Chevron.  Now that the Supreme Court has overturned this decision, how important is it that Congress act to codify those provisions?   
Mr. Carr.   Thank you, Congressman, for your leadership on this.   
I think the legislation that you have been leading on, the American Broadband 
Deployment Act would codify a lot of really smart ideas that would turn things around in this country and make sure that we can start actually building out broadband in a cost This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

39 
 effective way.  So I think particularly in light of Chevron, as you know to having Congress 
step in with clear authorization for this can only help.  
Mr. Carter.   Commissioner Simington, would you comment on that as well?  
Mr. Simington.   Yes, absolutely.  The past permitting reform at the FCC greatly 
increased buildout speed.  However, with --  in the post Chevron world, seeing action on 
this from Congress could only benefit closing the digital divide.   
Mr. Carter.   Great.   
Commissioner Carr, does the new digital discrimination regime adopted by the 
commission's majority put the Commission in by extension the trial bar in a position to second guess deployment decisions made by broadband providers?   
Mr. Carr.   Yeah, this provision was a one -page provision of law tucked into a 
1,000 page bill.  And the way the FCC read it, it was as if it conveyed more authorities in the entire 1934 communications act and every single statute or provision passed since then.  No was limit under the FCC's reading to authority now, whether it is Wall Street or 
Madison avenue or construction crews or even governments itself are now subject to 
second guessing by the FCC here in Washington.  
Mr. Carter.   So essentially how would the need to defend against these 
challenges likely decrease investment in risk taking by broadband providers?   
Mr. Carr.   We now have unlimited liability  based on the --  
Mr. Carter.   Exactly.  
Mr. Carr.   -- equity rule.  If you take an action, you, may be liable.  If you don't 
take an action, because it covers omissions as well, you might be liable.  And so it gives no certainty to capital allocators that need to put and that we should want billions of dollars to go into our networks.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 Mr. Carter.   Let me ask you about Loper Bright and the Supreme Court's decision 
there.  Does that effect FCC's recent digital discrimination rules?   
Mr. Carr.   I think the digital equity rules and the Title II rules in my view were 
always going to be subject to major questions doctrine not Chevron.  But fundamentally 
Chevron reinforces the idea that the Framers want you here in Congress to mike these decisions rather than having the FCC or other agencies take a provision of law that doesn't address an issue or only does so in an ambiguous way and claims expansive authority.   
So I think the Supreme Court's decision reinforces the constitutional structure of 
the people's representatives here making these fundamental decisions about what the Federal law should be.  
Mr. Carter.   What about you, commissioner Simington?   
Mr. Simington.   Well, on the merits I don't know how I would comply with the 
digital discrimination rules if I were in the position of having to make those decisions in 
business.  And I also don't know how we are going to enforce them.  It doesn't seem 
that there are any real standards as commissioner Carr said, anything that you do or fail to do maybe attributed against you.  
Mr. Carter.   Exactly.  
Mr. Simington.   So I agree with his analysis that this would likely come under 
major questions doctrine and not Chevron.  Nonetheless, I also agree with his statement 
about how the Supreme Court has allocated the balance of responsibilities.  
Mr. Carter.   Okay.  Commissioner Carr, disparate impact, that does not appear 
in section 6506 of the IIJA.  Given the complete absence of that and the complete 
absence of the explicit direction by Congress to employ such a standard in rules to This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 prevent digital discrimination, do you believe the Commission has erred in adopting such 
a standard in its new rules?  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

Mr. Carr.   It did.  The FCC created a record to look for instances of 
discrimination in the broadband market, and after 2 years, the FCC said its record 
indicated that there were no such instances of discrimination.   
Nonetheless, the FCC adopted the strong medicine of this disparate impact 
theory, which means, even if you have no intent to discriminate, the courts can come in 
and second -guess it.  What the courts have said is if Congress is going to create a 
disparate impact theory of liability, it has to use very clear specific words, again, because 
it is very strong medicine.  Those words were absent from the statute.   
Mr. Carter.   Commissioner Simington, do you have anything to add to that?   
Mr. Simington.   Just that, again, the reach of this also needs to be emphasized.  
Commissioner Carr mentioned that it reaches construction companies.  It reaches 
anyone who in some way limits access even if involuntarily or unknowingly.  So that is a 
very broad brush.   
Mr. Carter.   Great.  Well, obviously, this committee and this Congress have got 
a lot of work to do to help you guys.  So thank you very much for being here.  Again, I appreciate it.   
And I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman yields back the balance of his time.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from California's 29th District for 5 
minutes for questions.

 Matsui, for holding this important hearing.   
And I really appreciate the commissioners being here.  I appreciate the 
information that you are sharing with us, and I certainly agree and disagree with many of 
your opinions, but here we are.  I would love to discuss a few issues with you.   
I would like to start with the obvious off the top in that it is a travesty that my 
Republican colleagues have allowed the funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program to lapse.  The ACP was a vital lifeline for millions of Americans and tens of thousands of families in my district who would otherwise struggle to get connected and stay connected 
to the internet, a basic necessity in today's world.   
Allowing funding for this program to expire is negligent on the part of our 
Republican leadership, and I would like to once again urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to work with us to get the ACP up and running again.  All of us here on 
both sides of the aisle have constituents who benefited from this program.  This should be a no -brainer for all of us to work together on.   
I would like to start with my questions with the FCC's adoption of its $200 million 
School Cybersecurity Initiative last month, which I am happy to see that action.   
As you all know, it was widely reported that L.A. Unified School District, one of the 
largest in the country, suffered a massive cybersecurity attack in 2022 that compromised the records of thousands of students, including data on COVID test results, driver's licenses, and other personal information.  Improved cybersecurity for our students is 
critical in investing in and one that hits close to home not only with my community but 
communities across the country are at risk.  
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, what are the Commission's goals for this program, and 
what would success look like?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
44 
 Ms. Rosenworcel.   Thank you so much.   
As you know, cyber attacks are reaching school districts across the country, big 
districts like in Los Angeles and small ones like St. Landry Parish in Louisiana.  And 
restoring the networks for learning can take anywhere from 3 days to 3 months.   
So we took a look at the E -rate program, which has long supported broadband to 
our Nation's schools, and we decided that we would start a pilot program to try to understand this problem and then also understand what partners exist in the solution, and by that I mean the Department of Education, our colleagues at the Cybersecurity 
Infrastructure Security Agency, and also State and local officials.   
Mr. Cardenas.   Thank you very much.   
I would also like to thank the Commission for its efforts to require georouting 
solutions for wireless calls to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.  We have made great 
strides in improving our response to members of our communities who are experiencing a mental health crisis through the 988 Lifeline.  However, there is always progress to be 
made.   
Currently, when you call 988, you are routed to a call center based on your area 
code, as it should be.  If I were to call 988 from Washington, D.C., I would be connected 
with someone based in L.A. because that is where my phone is from.  This is a problem when a call center needs to send a mental health response team to help a caller that may be thousands of miles away.  The FCC's 998 georouting proposal would help solve this 
problem.   
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, can you talk about the Commission's 988 georouting 
proposal and the importance of the FCC's efforts to better connect Americans 
experiencing mental health crisis with location -specific resources?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
45 
 Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  988 has been around, this month, for 2 years, and in 
that time, 10 million people have reached out in crisis from all across the country to get 
help.  It is a success story, but we can make it better.  And the way we make it better is 
making sure that when someone reaches out for help, they get help from someone nearby.  And what we are doing with georouting is just that.  We are going to --  instead 
of using the area code, we would use the cell tower that is picking up the call to route to a crisis center.   
We have sent letters to carriers, we have done some testing, and we started a 
rulemaking to make sure we have technical standards.  Now, once we complete that rulemaking, we will need the Department of Health and Human Services to work with us to put it in the contract, but I believe all of that is possible this year.   
Mr. Cardenas.   Thank you very much.   
Commissioner Starks, can you provide your perspective and how Congress can 
support your work on this issue?   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  On 988, again, this is folks who are calling in a critical part of 
their life, need help, need it to be done close to where they are.  As we have heard, working with HHS, working with industry, it has been a real collective effort here as well as some of the resiliency and making sure that we have the right requirements in place.  It has been a real team effort.   
Mr. Cardenas.   Thank you very much.   
988 has yet to become as common around the country as 911, but it is moving 
forward fluidly and as it should, and I really appreciate the efforts that the FCC has done.  This is lifesaving work, and that is critical, and I think that is one of the main reasons why we all run for office, to make sure that our Americans are safe in every situation with This is an unedited transcript.

 every possibility.   
My time has expired.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Utah for 5 minutes for questions.   
Mr. Curtis.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, the Commission has decided to allow speed test 
submissions as a valid way to challenge claims of mobile service.  However, the FCC will 
not allow consumers to submit speed test data to verify claims of fixed service.   
Can you explain why the Commission would not allow a speed test as a valid 
individual challenge to the fixed broadband map?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  This is a good question and one we are working 
through, but I want to correct one or two things you have said.   
Mr. Curtis.   Sure.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Okay.  With respect to fixed challenges, we do accept speed 
tests for availability data to prove that services present are not present.   
With respect to the actual speeds, it is more complicated, because where you 
place your router in your house has a huge impact on your speeds.  We are looking for a statistical way to validate this so that we can use that data more comprehensively going forward.  I would be happy to make sure your office is kept updated.  
Mr. Curtis.   Thank you.  Yes, I would appreciate that.   
Also, I would like to talk about mapping.  The FCC's National Broadband Map acts 
as the base layer of coordination for important broadband funding programs, including the BEAD.  Ensuring that these maps are accurate and up to date will ensure that funds are not wasted and the digital divide is closed quickly and effectively.  Part of that This is an unedited transcript.

 process is challenging the serviceability broadband location.   
Can you explain how the Commission works with CostQuest to review challenge 
data and why demonstratable on -the-ground proof of service might be rejected as a valid 
bulk challenge to the underlying Fabric data?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   All right.  It is a complex process we set up.  We did it 
pursuant to the Broadband DATA Act, which is legislation from this committee.  And 
what you said about this map and its data being our accountability program for all these broadband spending dollars, I just want to agree with you.  That is spot on.   
So it is imperative we get it right, and when we get it right, that occurs when we 
take updates from our vendor, CostQuest, which helps manage our Fabric and also updates from carriers, consumers, and local and State authorities.  We try to combine all that information and crowdsource it and get the best map possible.  It is an iterative process.  We take all that data in and update it every 6 months.  And I would be happy to provide more information about just how we do that if you would like.  
Mr. Curtis.   Okay.  And with the BEAD program set to improve most, if not all, 
of State proposals by the end of July, the FCC's National Broadband Map, NBM, is a critical component in making those funding decisions.   
As FCC continues to update and refine the NBM, how does the FCC plan to address 
providers who overstate their coverage?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, first, providers that overstate their coverage in a willful, 
malicious, and dishonest way, we send them to enforcement and take action against them.  There are incidental overstatements, and we rely on State officials, authorities, and customers to correct them.   
But in addition to our process of assessing where service is and is not, I know that This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
48 
 the BEAD program requires every State to run its own process.  And that is important 
too, because I really believe local and State officials have a better command of what is 
going on in their backyard, and that has got to inform where they spend those dollars.  
Mr. Curtis.   Thank you.   
Also, Commissioner Carr, if you would also weigh in on this.   
In May, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to strengthen 
requirements and oversight of Telecommunications Certified Bodies, TCBs.  I think this is 
an important action to strengthen our national security.  Can you discuss how the threat 
posed by TCBs with no ties to our adversaries?   
Mr. Carr.   Yeah.  Thank you, Congressman, for the question, and thanks for your 
leadership on all these national security issues.   
This one is interesting.  So, over the years, Congress has passed laws that have 
asked the FCC to stop insecure network gear from getting into our networks.  This 
proposal builds on that, because the idea here is let's make sure that the labs and other 
certification bodies that are checking for this equipment are themselves trustworthy 
actors.   
I really want to thank the chair in particular and her team for the work to move 
that forward to a proposal.  I look forward to trying to get that to an order soon.  I think it will be another piece of our overall national security strategy.  
Mr. Curtis.   Chairwoman, would you like to comment as well?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   It is really important that we update our Telecommunications 
Certification Bodies and the labs that give them data, and I have been working with Commissioner Carr on this.  I agree with everything he just said.  
Mr. Curtis.   Thank you.  Thank you for your succinct answers.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 Chairman, I yield my time.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman yields back the balance of his time.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Michigan's Sixth District for 5 
minutes for questions.   
Mrs. Dingell.   Thank you, Mr. Chair.   
And thanks again to everybody for joining us today.   
I do want to say, as I said in my opening statement, we really do need to fund the 
Affordable Connectivity Program.  There is no question about it.  Many people in my 
State have talked about it.   
In Michigan, nearly 1 million households  -- one in four households in the State of 
Michigan have saved money on their internet bills because of the ACP.  We needed to 
act yesterday.  It is crucial for ensuring that all Americans are able to participate in the digital economy, access education and healthcare resources, and stay connected to essential services.  I just urge all of my colleagues to work with us to get this program 
funded.  And as I said in opening remarks, I have had people crying because they can't 
afford it.  It is bad.   
I am working on legislation to address the threat of domestic abusers exploiting 
connectivity tools in vehicles to harass and intimidate their partners.  This effort would establish a process for survivors to request determination or the disabling of connected 
vehicle services that abusers could misuse, ensuring their safety and confidentiality 
without imposing additional burdens on them.  This would also allow survivors to 
maintain access to a vehicle, which is a crucial tool for achieving safety and independence.   
We have to take proactive measures to address the vulnerabilities in connected This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
50 
 vehicles.  Ensuring that modern vehicle communications contribute to the safety of 
domestic abuser survivors is essential.   
Madam Chair, in April, the Commission issued a Further Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking to support survivors of domestic abuse and sexual violence.  Could you provide an update on the Commission's progress?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Thank you for that.   
I think you know right now cars are like smartphones on wheels.  They are very 
sophisticated.  
Mrs. Dingell.   Which most people don't know.  Yeah.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   They are very sophisticated.  They can track where we go 
and what we do.  And there have been press reports that they have been weaponized for victims of domestic violence.   
We can fix this.  It is within our power.  Congress already directed us with the 
Safe Connections Act to make survivors of domestic violence have more secure 
communications.  We have got to apply similar policies to our vehicles.   
So I appreciate what you are working on.  I will make sure that what we do at the 
FCC we coordinate with you so that we can work in lockstep to solve this problem.  
Mrs. Dingell.   I really want to do that.  And we will be introducing bipartisan 
legislation on this because, by allowing individuals to disable or terminate access to 
connective vehicle services that abusers could exploit, we are going to protect them.  
That is just pure and simple dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and sex trafficking.   
Let me move to robocalls.  As I brought up in previous hearings in front of this 
committee, we know that bad actors can take advantage of our vulnerable populations 
through robocalls and robotexts.  Often driven by artificial intelligence, scammers can This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
51 
 exploit vulnerable consumers by using tactics to deceive them.  While AI has the power 
to make it easier for consumers to give information they are looking for, unfortunately, it 
is also used to trick them.   
I appreciate the work all the Commission is doing on combating robocalls and 
robotexts, holding these scammers accountable.   
Again, Madam Chair, what do you most need from Congress to help the FCC stay 
ahead of the scammers?  Would more resources for consumer education help?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   The answer is yes, but I have got a few things that I think 
would be really, really helpful.  The first is this:  It was about a year and a half ago that 
the Supreme Court issued an opinion that narrowed the definition of "auto dialer" under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  It took huge swaths of these calls out from our oversight.  It means we get more junk that is now not accountable.  I would like to rework with you on the definition of "auto dialer", update it so that we can go after more of these bad actors.   
We also in the last year and a half issued $650 million of fines.  That is a lot.  
But every one of those fines I have to turn over to my colleagues at the Department of Justice, and it takes a really long time for them to go enforce them against those scam artists.  I would like to have the authority to do it ourself.   
And, separately, I would like access to data from the Bank Secrecy Act.  
Increasingly, we are identifying that these scam artists are so sophisticated, they will set 
up a company, we find them and shut them down, and they set up something else 
somewhere else using the same bank accounts.  The more that we have access to their financial information, the more we will be able to shut down large enterprises responsible for this junk.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
52 
 Mrs. Dingell.   Thank you.   
I don't have a lot of time left, but would any of the other commissioners like to 
add to that?   
Mr. Carr.   Thank you, Congresswoman, for your leadership on this.   
One issue that came to mind when we were talking about the connectivity in 
vehicles that I have been starting to focus a bit more on is -- particularly as we see this 
rush of vehicles coming in from China  -- when you look at the capacity of connectivity and 
the surveillance capacity and the information that we pulled in, I think that is something 
that merits attention because, again, we are looking at everything from drones to 
applications to devices themselves.  I think we need to continue to scrutinize this issue as well.   
Mrs. Dingell.   I am out of time, so I will yield back, Mr. Chair, and submit some 
more questions for the record.  Thanks to all of you.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you very much.  The gentlelady's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan's Fifth District for 5 
minutes for questions.   
Mr. Walberg.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
And thanks to the witnesses for being here today.  I appreciate you taking this 
time.   
With the recent Supreme Court Chevron deference decision and the scrutiny of 
the administrative enforcement powers and discretion, do you have  -- Commissioner 
Carr, do you have concerns with the FCC's enforcement process which often lacks due process protections that would require additional congressional action, and if so, how would you reform the FCC's processes?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
53 
 Mr. Carr.   I think there is a number of Supreme Court cases recently that really 
require the FCC to think about correcting course.  One of them is a Supreme Court case 
called Jarkesy, which has to do with administrative agencies and enforcement.  I think 
the FCC should start a proceeding to take a look at our existing enforcement mechanisms to make sure that they align with the constitutional parameters outlined by the Supreme Court.  Otherwise, we could be taking enforcement actions that end up getting overturned in court.  So I think we need to take a refresh on our enforcement procedures right now.   
Mr. Walberg.   Thank you.   
Chair Rosenworcel, again, my condolences as well with my colleagues.   
Recently, New York's broadband law was allowed to go into effect, mandating that 
all fixed broadband providers offer qualifying low -income customers a $15 or $20 service 
at specified speeds.  In past hearings, you have told me you opposed rate regulation.  In fact, no asterisks.  I will never forget that.  And in your recent order, reclassifying 
broadband under Title II, you specifically forbeared from rate regulation of any kind.   
So, Madam Chair, does your order preempt States from engaging in rate 
regulation of broadband, and do you support the New York law?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, first things first, we said no rate regulation as a result of 
our Title II reclassification.  I have repeatedly said to you I don't support that either ex 
post or ex ante, and apparently I said no asterisks as well.   
Mr. Walberg.   Right.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   That being said, what you are talking about is a State law that 
a court let go into effect.  There is no petition before us, but we did say in our order that State broadband affordability efforts do not per se violate our rules.  We will look at any This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
54 
 individual cases if a petition is filed before us, and one is not before us right now.   
Mr. Walberg.   Commissioner Carr, would you like to comment on that?   
Mr. Carr.   The FCC's Title II decision, regardless of what your view as a policy 
matter is on that, plainly preempts New York State law.  It is true that the FCC said that 
if a program is labeled as a State broadband affordability, it is not necessarily preempted, but you have to look at the substance.  And the substance of the New York law is naked rate regulation, and we should step up and be clear that we don't support rate regulation and that that provision of New York law is preempted by operation of the agency's Title II 
decision.   
Mr. Walberg.   Well, I would hope you would hammer that out as a commission 
because, frankly, with impunity going against what has been put in place by Federal 
standard ought to concern us all.   
Commissioner Carr, both of us have been long -time champions for boosting our 
telecommunications workforce.  You have climbed towers.  I have offered to climb 
towers, but nobody wants an old guy to go up, I guess.  So we need young people out 
there.  I still hear from providers all the time about their workforce struggles as they try to connect people across my district.   
Do you have an update on what the telecommunications workforce looks like now 
and what more can be done, if anything?   
Mr. Carr.   Thanks for the question.  I very much look forward to getting up a 
tower with you.  I think that would be a lot of fun.  I am happy to come to your district for that.   
Look, there is billions of dollars, as we have talked about  -- even putting BEAD to 
the side --  that are going to be rolling out to connect communities, and we are barreling This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
55 
 towards a workforce shortage.  Again, the 42 billion BEAD dollars haven't hit the ground 
yet, but when they do, that is going to put a real strain on workforce challenges.  And so 
we need to be getting ahead of that now.   
We have been looking to community college programs to stand these up, but we 
need to sort of move a little faster on that effort.   
Mr. Walberg.   Okay.  Well, we can all join arms together on that because, 
frankly, this is now and this is the future.  We can't get behind.   
So, Mr. Chair, I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman yields back.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from California's 16th District for 5 
minutes for questions.   
Ms. Eshoo.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman and our Ranking Member Matsui, for 
holding this important oversight hearing.   
To the chairwoman  -- distinguished chairwoman, thank you, and welcome.  And 
to each commissioner, it is good to see you all.   
This may be the last time I participate in an FCC oversight hearing, and I want to 
thank the Commission for the work that you are doing, the work that has been done.   
This is my 32nd year as a Member of the House of Representatives, the great 
privilege of my life, and 30 years as a member of this subcommittee.  So while previous 
commissioners and chairmen are not in the chamber, I still want to salute them for their 
work.   
I am not going to go through all of the marvelous things that the FCC is doing and 
has done  -- this FCC Commission.  The chairwoman did that magnificently.  We should 
all take pride in that.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
56 
 They are not only proposals but policies that have been put in place, number one, 
for our national security.  When we take our oath of office to protect and defend, that is 
you as well as us.  That is our number one priority.  And I am proud that the 
Commission finally paid attention, under your leadership, Madam Chairwoman.  I knocked down the door for a long time to raise the specter of what the Chinese Government was not only capable of doing but was already doing.  So I salute you for that.   
Commissioner Carr, I want to say a few things to you.  It is obvious that I don't 
agree with you on just about everything you said today.  You know, there is an old saying that there are those who know the price of everything but ignore the cost for those who are affected.   
I ran for Congress to lift people up, to improve the lives of the American people.  
And the more American people that are lifted up to share in the dream of this country, the better off we all are.  The better off we all are.  To disparage the BEAD program 
and other undertakings of the Commission that really look after the working stiffs in this 
country I think is just dead wrong.  When we push people down, we are hurting ourselves.   
I think that Commissioner Gomez' testimony of who she has met, who has written 
to her, is one of the great --  they are great voices of this country.   
So I regret that -- you know, I mean, it was said this morning by the chairwoman of 
the full committee really berating the Commission, and yet every single Republican of this subcommittee and full committee voted against expanding broadband in our country.   
When I say I served here, I have served on this subcommittee for 30 years.  For 
over 20 of those years, Republicans and Democrats were wringing their hands to not only This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 have a map but that we invest in it.  And then when it came time for that to be the 
dream come true for our country, no.  Is that hypocrisy?  I don't know what it is.  The 
one thing I know what it is is that I think it is very wrong.  Very wrong.   
Our country is made up of extraordinary ordinary people.  Extraordinary ordinary 
people.  And when our policies stray from that, we stray away from the core of what this 
democracy is all about.   
So I hope that --  let me just give Chairwoman Rosenworcel a moment to accuse 
the -- Commissioner Carr accused the FCC of unjustly revoking a contract with Starlink to 
provide broadband to over 600,000 homes.  Do you want to address that?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  First, you have been a formidable voice on this 
committee, and I am grateful for the role model you have made, making clear that women can speak up without apology.   
With respect to what you were speaking about earlier, the last administration 
made distribution decisions under our rural universal service program 2 weeks before an 
election.  I inherited those decisions.  We did a full financial and technical review of 
every preliminary winning bidder.  We found about a dozen of them did not meet financial or technical marks.   
Mr. Latta.   If the gentlelady could finish up.  The gentlelady's time has expired.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Just 1 second.  One of them was a satellite service because 
they couldn't consistently meet upload and download down -link speeds.   
In addition, the company you are mentioning had 6,500 census blocks --   
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady's time has expired.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   -- that were already served  --

 Ms. Rosenworcel.   -- or traffic medians or airports or downtown Chicago.  
Mr. Latta.   Your question can be taken to a QFR.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   We asked them to take the service out.  They refused.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.   
Ms. Eshoo.   Thank you.  I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania's 13th 
District for 5 minutes of questions.   
Mr. Joyce.   Thank you, Chairman Latta and Ranking Member Matsui, for holding 
this oversight hearing.   
I also appreciate the chairman and all the commissioners for taking time to testify 
today.   
Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, as I have emphasized to you in the 
past, is incredibly rural.  It has hills and hollers, nooks and crannies, surrounded by 
mountains.   
I appreciate the efforts that the FCC has taken so far to focus on connecting all 
Americans, specifically the constituents of Pennsylvania 13.  With that comes the responsibility to manage large amounts of grants and Federal funding.  This funding is going out to providers not only in my district but over the entirety of this great land.   
Chair Rosenworcel, last week, the FCC announced that it will not provide 
broadband relief for RDOF and CAF II providers that default on their build -out obligations.  
I applaud that decision.  Providers should be required to fulfill their obligation to the American people.  This issue raises an important consideration about the coordination between the FCC and NTIA as the BEAD program is rolled out.   
How are the two agencies coordinating to ensure that there is not overbuilding of This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
59 
 RDOF and CAF build -out locations within the BEAD program?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Thank you, Congressman.   
This is a really important question.  We have so many broadband programs, we 
need to make sure we take those resources and use them in a smart way.   
We have got two initiatives at the FCC that speak to your question.  First, in the 
last month, I signed, again, a memorandum of understanding with the Department of 
Treasury, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Commerce, to make sure that we coordinate on all data with our broadband programs.   
Second, I am producing something called the Broadband Funding Map, and it 
doesn't get enough attention.  It is a map of all of the enforceable commitments under our broadband programs in the United States.  We can use that map for accountability to make sure there is no overbuilding and that we make sure we reach everyone.  That map is really important, and I encourage every member of this committee to become familiar with it.  
Mr. Joyce.   Thank you.  And I appreciate you bringing that into this discussion.   
This rollout is going to be the largest investment of a decade, and might be the 
best chance that we get to connect rural Americans.  It is our responsibility to use this opportunity to ensure that my constituents are able to connect to reliable and high- speed 
internet.   
The 5G Fund is another important funding source that enables rural connectivity.  
It is imperative that the 5G Fund is distributed efficiently and results in actual 5G wireless services being provided to rural areas.  This program is intended to replace portions of current High Cost Fund, and millions of rural communities risk losing connectivity if it is not implemented correctly.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
60 
 Commissioner Carr, as written, the 5G Fund uses a minimum of 7/1 speeds.  
Previous FCC programs require speed thresholds with higher minimums, reflecting 
services that consumers want and have come to expect, and 7/1 is clearly low for 5G 
standards.   
Are you concerned that lowering the bar on the speed thresholds would degrade 
the intent of the fund?   
Mr. Carr.   Thank you, Congressman, for the leadership, and thanks for your work 
in your district.  I have enjoyed the chance to spend some time there with you in a 
broadband roundtable that you organized.   
With the 5G Fund, I voted previously to move forward with it.  I have called for 
this agency to do it.  I think the most important question right now is, how do we do so 
in a way that makes sense with the BEAD program that is underway as well so we can align the two programs in a way that makes sense from a timing and other perspective?   
But you are right, we should be funding services at the end of the day with the 5G 
Fund that are capable of offering 5G services.  
Mr. Joyce.   Chair Rosenworcel, can it truly be called a 5G Fund if the technical 
parameters in the current order will not reliably provide 5G services?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   All right.  I want to just acknowledge where we are right 
now.   
We have a draft that I have put before my colleagues.  We are talking about the 
draft, including service levels, what is viable in different parts of the country, what technologies are going to be used to make sure that we get to everyone.  So we are not done with this process yet, and I will make sure that our conversations take what you just said into account.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
61 
 Mr. Joyce.   Thank you.  We would appreciate that, and if you could make this 
committee aware as you proceed with that.   
Congress must ensure that we are providing Federal grants to communities where 
they are needed.  All of us need to be responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollar and 
providing funds to rural areas  -- not just large urban centers  -- where the connectivity will 
be life -changing and, in some cases, truly life -sustaining.   
I thank all of you for being with us here today and for giving your time, and I yield 
the balance of my time.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman yields back.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois' Second District for 5 minutes 
for questions.   
Ms. Kelly.   Thank you, Chair Latta and Ranking Member Matsui, for holding this 
important hearing this morning.   
And I also want to thank the witnesses -- commissioners for their testimony.   
I know that closing the digital divide in these communities cannot be 
accomplished without bold, innovative solutions, and that is why I have been supportive of the Affordable Connectivity Program, or ACP, which helps eligible low -income 
households afford the broadband they needed.  The success of this program is undeniable, as nearly 23 million Americans have been enrolled in the program.   
Similarly, with over 2,000 farms in my district, I am keenly aware of the need to 
expand broadband connectivity in rural and agricultural areas, to ensure farmers can take advantage of the benefits of precision agriculture.   
Commissioner Starks, can you share how the FCC is working to bring connectivity 
to our country's agricultural areas, and what role do you see fixed wireless technology This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
62 
 playing in helping connect rural America?   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  Thank you so much for the question.   
I attended the Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois, many years ago, and so I 
might have met some of the farmers that are in your district there and heard directly 
from them what they need for their farms for precision agriculture, what they need to keep family members who --  and their way of life.   
And so, so much of what we are doing  -- I think the 5G Mobility Fund will make a 
play on how we are going to help get agricultural better connected.  Obviously, the 
RDOF that we have discussed here today also has a real play.  But as you pinpointed as 
well, I think fixed wireless is going to absolutely -- has grown exponentially.  I have seen 
it as my time as a commissioner, and will continue to play a large role.  
Ms. Kelly.   Thank you very much.   
Shifting gears to the FCC's upcoming July open Commission meeting where it was 
recently announced that the agency would consider the implementation of Martha 
Wright -Reed Act  -- of the Martha Wright- Reed Act and how to adopt just and reasonable 
rate caps for incarcerated people's audio and video communication services.   
Delivering these reforms and ultimately providing relief to incarcerated persons 
and their families is critical, especially as there have been reports that hundreds of county 
jails around the U.S. have eliminated in -person visits, making often pricey video calls the 
only visual connection between detainees and their family.   
Chairwoman, I am encouraged to see the FCC will be considering rules to 
implement the bipartisan Martha Wright -Reed Act at the agency's July open meeting.  
To level set, can you explain the importance of this act championed in the House by my friend, Representative Bobby Rush, and how incarcerated people, their families, and all of This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
63 
 our communities benefit from these rules?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  It was almost 2 years ago that a grandmother, Martha 
Wright, wrote us and complained that she was paying absolutely usurious amounts to 
stay in touch with her grandson who was incarcerated.  And when the agency looked into it, we found that for a single call lots of families were paying more than you and I pay for our monthly unlimited plans.  That is not right.  And it doesn't just harm families of the incarcerated; it harms all of us because regular contact with family and kin reduces recidivism.   
Now, for years, we have tried to fix this problem.  We have gone back and forth 
with the courts.  But, finally, former Congressman Rush, along with Senator Duckworth -- there is a lot of Illinois here --  came forward and said here is some authority 
to help you fix that problem.  And this month, I am proud to report that I expect our agency to do just that.   
Ms. Kelly.   Thank you so much.   
I am committed to ensuring that incarcerated people can communicate with their 
loved ones without having to worry about unfair, exorbitant fees, so please know that my staff plans to follow up with you all to learn more about the agency's work in this space.   
Lastly, I want to know that there has been quite a lot of discussion recently about 
the FCC starting a proceeding to consider banning or otherwise limiting bulk billing arrangements in multi- premises environments.  From the comments I have received 
from my district, such an effort could raise concerns.   
They tell me both deals help keep prices low and give them higher -performance 
broadband, and ending these deals could eliminate these benefits.  But I also understand that there are many variations of what these arrangements could look like, This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 and in some cases they may be driving consumer frustration.   
I recognize the FCC has yet to adopt the proposal and seek comment on it, so I will 
continue to monitor the FCC's efforts on this issue and the comments the agency receives 
to ensure the agency is putting consumers' interests first.   
With that, I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady yields back the balance of her time.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida's 12th District for 5 minutes 
for questions.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate it very much.   
To follow up with Ms. Kelly, you can see this is a bipartisan issue.   
Chair Rosenworcel, you recently announced an NPRM that would prevent bulk 
billing arrangements between the broadband providers and housing communities.  Since that announcement, I have received letters from 140 constituents unanimously in opposition to the proposal, fearing it would significantly increase costs.  So I am glad 
that Ms. Kelly brought this up as well.  It is a great concern for our seniors.   
The vast majority of these messages come from those residing, again, in senior 
living communities on fixed incomes.  Particularly now with the inflation being so very 
high, it is so very difficult for our seniors.   
An FCC report and order in 2010 aligns with these constituent concerns stating, 
and I quote, It would be a disservice to the public interest if, in order to benefit a few 
residents, we prohibited bulk billing, because so doing would result in higher MVPD 
service charges for the vast majority of multi- dwellings unit residents who are content 
with such arrangements.   
And I have a letter from Timber Pines.  Timber Pines is an adult This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

65 
 community -- senior community in my district in Spring Hill, Florida.  Many letters from 
Timber Pines.   
How is it in the public interest, Commissioner Chair, to directly cause increased 
rates for a significant number of Americans under this proposal?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  I think we can all agree that broadband is an essential 
service, and we also have policies in place that prevent there from being exclusives in 
apartment buildings that lock up an apartment building so that folks can't get any other provider and benefit from competition.   
One-third of the people in this country live in apartment buildings or multiunit 
dwellings.  That is a lot of people.  But what we are finding now is they are bypassing those exclusive prohibitions and just baking it into the rent or assessment fees on each apartment and unit.   
And so what I have received as the chair of the agency are a lot of complaints from 
consumers who say, everyone else gets competition; why don't I get competition?  Why 
do I have to pay for this service if I don't want to use it?   
So what we have proposed is a rulemaking to ask those questions, mindful that 
there are some constituents, including folks like the ones you described, who might like 
these services.  But it has been 14 years since we looked at this issue, and 14 years in broadband is a long time.  We want everyone to have the benefit of competition.  So opening this issue up for public comment I think is the right thing to do.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Well, keep in mind, again, you know, these seniors are in fixed 
incomes.  It is a big concern.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I promise you that we will do that as we proceed.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Please.  Please.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
66 
 Commissioner Carr, what is your take on this proposal?   
Mr. Carr.   I think the FCC should withdraw this proposal.  I think it could only 
raise the prices for Americans living in these types of buildings.   
And I think when you think about competition, the building or premises owner 
have a lot of market power, and, in fact, they are competing in a market for services that 
is very robust.  So if you were to prohibit bulk billing, you would be going from a really frothy competitive environment and force people to get broadband services in a relatively less competitive environment.   
So it is bad for competition, and it is bad for prices.  I don't think right now is the 
time when we should be saddling Americans with that.  The FCC has looked at this issue multiple times over the years and found that they do more good than harm, and I think we should stick with that.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Thank you.  Thank you, sir.   
I still have a couple more minutes.  Not a couple, but quite a few seconds.   
Commissioner Carr, we are constantly trying to ensure our international 
leadership in various industries, including the wireless marketplace.  What effect will the FCC's Title II order have on American leadership in wireless technology?   
Mr. Carr.   Well, I think it is a headwind, right.  It only makes it harder to build 
out and invest.  And more broadly, I think if you look at this administration, it has fallen into a real deep malaise when it comes to one of these most important considerations for 
economic growth, which is wireless.   
Right now, we have no plan to turn things around.  Even though we do have a 
lapsed general spectrum auction authority, we do have authority still to auction 
spectrum.  In fact, just last week, the FCC missed a statutory deadline to auction 30 This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
67 
 megahertz of spectrum because the Commerce Department, in 2022, failed to meet a 
2015 era statutory deadline imposed by Congress for identifying that specific 30 
megahertz.   
So not only do we not have auction authority, but the administration isn't taking 
the steps that would let us move forward with auctions even where we do still have 
authority.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Thank you very much.   
And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate it.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from New York's Ninth District for 5 
minutes for questions.   
Ms. Clarke.   Let me thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank our ranking 
member.   
I thank our commissioners for appearing before us today.  Let me thank you for 
all of your hard work and your dedication.   
And under the leadership of Chairwoman Rosenworcel, this commission has done 
critical work to protect consumers and our communications networks, promote innovation, and ensure access to high- speed affordable internet connectivity.  It is a 
reality for all Americans.   
Due to the work of the Democrats on this committee, the FCC, until recently, 
responsible for administering one of the most successful programs in bridging the digital divide, the Affordable Connectivity Program, and now awaiting some movement to get this program back in place.   
As I have noted at countless hearings over the last year, the undeniable success of This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 the ACP brought affordable high- speed broadband across to more than 23 million 
households.  Unfortunately, House Republican leadership has blocked my bipartisan, 
bicameral legislation to save the ACP from receiving consideration on the floor of the 
House, and funding for the ACP lapsed over a month ago, leaving millions of households forced to choose between paying for broadband or other essentials like food and medication.   
Despite the continued Republican blockade of critical funding to the ACP, I remain 
hopeful that we can come together in a bipartisan manner to save this critical program 
and to close the digital divide once and for all.   
My first question this morning is on the mechanics of the potential restart of the 
Affordable Connectivity Program.  One concern with allowing ACP funding to lapse even 
temporarily has been the potential cost of reenrollment.   
It is essential that we do not lose the sense of urgency regarding ACP funding.  If 
we allow the ACP to remain inactive for more than a few months, we must keep in mind the enormous strain the increased cost of service is having on families and remember 
that any attempt to restart or refresh the program after a long pause would require a significant undertaking to reengage skeptical households that previously relied on the ACP before the lapse in funding.   
So, Chair Rosenworcel, with the lapse in ACP funding, are we still within the 
window of time where restarting the ACP program would not require significant 
investment in reenrollment of subscribers, and if so, how much time do we have left?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yes.  Well, thank you for your leadership on this issue, and 
like you, I am an optimist we can get this done.  We have systems still in place at our 
administrator.  We still know every benefit -qualifying individual that signed up for this This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 program, and we have got hundreds of outreach partners across the country who are 
ready to go if Congress finds a way to continue this program.   
I will keep you posted before we turn any of those systems off.  Again, I am still 
hopeful that Congress will be able to refund this program because it has been so consequential when it comes to ending the digital divide.  
Ms. Clarke.   Likewise.  And thank you so much, Chairwoman.   
In addition to equitable access to broadband services, one of my top priorities for 
years has been increasing the diversity and independence of the media marketplace.  To 
that end, I was very pleased to see the Commission's May announcement of the NPRM on 
fostering independent and diverse sources of video programming.   
The inclusion of unreasonable Alternative Distribution Methods, ADM, and the 
most -favored -Nation provisions in carriage agreements can prove significant obstacles for 
independent programmers seeking carriage -run both Multichannel Video Programming 
Distributors, or MVPDs, and online platforms.  And while innovations in the marketplace 
have given consumers multiple ways to consume video content, carriage on MVPDs 
remain critical for networks of all sizes, especially emerging media companies.   
So, Chairwoman, what is the FCC doing or what can it do to ensure independent 
programmers can equitably compete for carriage, and how do you see the marketplace for independent programmers on MVPDs and online video distribution platforms evolving?   
And Commissioner Starks and Gomez are welcome to offer your thoughts as well.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   The ways we watch are changing.  Every one of us now can 
bring up what we want when we want it on any piece of glass handy, and yet there are old problems that persist on traditional channel lineups.  New voices, independent This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 programmers can't always get a fair shot.  We hear that over and over again.   
So 2 months ago, we started a new rulemaking on this to get an updated record to 
understand what the problem looks like in this new media environment.  We can keep 
you posted as the record develops.   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  The only thing I would add --  
Mr. Latta.   Pardon me.  About 10 seconds because the gentlelady's time has 
expired.   
Mr. Starks.   Yes, sir.   
The only thing I would add, in the media space, the last time we looked at this was 
2016.  Anytime you are talking about such a long gap, it is worthwhile for us to have a refresh.   
Ms. Clarke.   Very well.   
And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.   
But I just wanted to ask this.  Commissioner Gomez, if you have comments, 
would you send them to us in writing because my time has elapsed.   
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you very much.  The gentlelady's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia's 12th for 5 minutes for 
questions.   
Mr. Allen.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for convening this hearing of the fiscal year 
2025 Federal Communications Commission agency budget.   
And I want to thank the commissioners for being here today.   
I would like to start by recognizing the Commission for their unanimous adoption 
of the declaratory ruling in February which recognized that calls made with AI -generated This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 voices are artificial under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  So thank you for 
that.   
Yesterday, I introduced my Creating Legal and Ethical AI Recording Voices, or 
CLEAR Voices Act.  This bill would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to establish technical and procedural standards for artificial or prerecorded voice systems created through generative artificial intelligence.   
Consistently, some of the biggest concerns I hear from constituents are regarding 
the robocalls, scam calls, and texts.  With the increasing use of AI in communication, 
maintaining public trust is crucial, and the CLEAR Voices Act takes great strides in doing 
that.   
Chair Rosenworcel, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to prohibit 
all early termination fees imposed by cable and direct broadcast service providers.  Even President Biden's statement in connection with his junk fees executive order proposed addressing ETFs only to the extent that they are unjust or unreasonable, which 
appropriately recognizes the contractual nature of the ETFs and the benefits customers 
receive when opting for term contracts.   
Would it not be more appropriate for the FCC to instead address only unjust or 
unreasonable ETF practices, such as failure to fully disclose them, and not just implement an outright ban?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   So we have an open proceeding on this.  We haven't made a 
decision yet.  We have lots of consumers who complain about early termination fees.  They signed up for a contract, but then they got saddled with some big lump sum they had to pay when they want to get out of it.  We are trying to understand what the scope of what is reasonable is there.  That is why we have an open proceeding on this subject.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
72 
 I appreciate what you said.  We will make sure we take it into consideration.   
Mr. Allen.   Okay.  The draft NPRM does not explain how an outright ban of ETFs 
would be reasonable given the cost savings and other consumer benefits available 
through term contracts with ETFs and given the month- to-month service options also 
available to consumers.   
How do you justify removing customers' options to choose to get a discount in 
exchange for agreeing to take service for a specified time period?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, that is why we are having a rulemaking.  We are asking 
to try to identify what is reasonable under the context.  That is the purpose of having a rulemaking.  That is the purpose of asking the public, and I hope we can shape the definition of "reasonable" as part of that effort.   
Mr. Allen.   Commissioner Carr, the chairwoman has announced plans to move 
forward the 5G Fund.  While I support closing the digital divide that exists in rural America, I am worried that adding the 5G Fund on top of the Rural Digital Opportunity 
Fund, the BEAD fund, the Capital Projects Fund, and the ReConnect Program will lead to 
wasted funding instead of connectivity.   
Do you see this overwhelming amount of broadband dollars as a reason for 
concern as the FCC considers the rules for the 5G Fund?   
Mr. Carr.   Thanks, Congressman, for the question.   
I supported before moving forward with the 5G Fund, but you are right, there has 
been sort of a sea change in the amount of Federal support that is out there since then.  Not just the $42 billion of BEAD, but by my count, we have made over $800 billion available that could be used for infrastructure, including broadband infrastructure.   
So as we proceed with the 5G Fund, we have to be so very mindful of all these This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
73 
 other programs and how do we make sure we move forward in a smart, coordinated way, 
and those are still issues that I think need to be worked out.   
Mr. Allen.   Wouldn't it be wise to wait till the BEAD funding is at least partially 
deployed so that 5G Fund is available to fill in the gaps instead of duplicate funding?   
Mr. Carr.   That is one of the arguments that we are looking at very closely, is how 
do you align this with BEAD.  There is the argument that if you wait until after BEAD, you could potentially have the 5G Fund go further.  Others argue that they want to move forward sooner in order to take advantage of the connectivity that would be enabled, and 
that sort of wrestling of those issues is what we are sort of looking at right now.   
Mr. Allen.   Chair Rosenworcel, with the NTIA BEAD funding program set to 
approve most, if not all, State proposals by the end of July, the FCC's National Broadband 
Map is a critical component in making those decisions.   
As the FCC continues to update and refine the NBM, how does the FCC plan to 
address providers who overstate coverage?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   If you willfully or maliciously overstate your coverage, we will 
send you to our Enforcement Bureau, and we will take action.  We have already done so.   
We are also using all available processes to make sure that that data is accurate, 
including challenges from State, local authorities, other carriers, and consumers.  And we welcome any information that you have from your office, and we can incorporate that 
into our mapping efforts too.   
Mr. Allen.   Thank you.   
My time is up.  I yield back.

It is clear the agency has gotten straight to work, from the implementation of the 
Safe Connections Act, which I helped pass, to protect survivors of domestic violence, to its 
work fighting robocalls and protecting Americans from harmful scams.   
The FCC also administers, we have discussed today, the Affordable Connectivity 
Program, making broadband more affordable for 22 million American households, including nearly 40,000 in my district in New Hampshire.  But my Republican colleagues continue to refuse to fund this program, leading to millions of Americans losing access to affordable broadband that they rely upon.   
As chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, I led multiple letters with our 
Members to House and Senate leadership urging them to put politics aside and fund the 
ACP.  I will continue fighting to fund the ACP.   
In the 21st century, access to reliable, affordable internet is not a luxury.  It is a 
necessity, including, I might add, for our own defense.  When we are talking about 
recruitment and we are falling short of our recruitment goals, how the hell would 
somebody sign up to serve in our military if they did not have access to the internet?   
From connecting job seekers to employers, to accessing telehealth services and 
education, the ACP has helped millions of hardworking Americans stay connected.   
As a founder and co -chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use 
Disorder Task Force, I am committed to ensuring that individuals in crisis can access the help they need when they need it.  The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is an important This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 first step in these efforts, but while this lifeline may help to connect callers to resources, 
these resources aren't guaranteed to be local.   
Currently, if someone calls 988 from the State of New Hampshire, their 603 phone 
number, their call will be routed to local crisis centers in New Hampshire, even if they find themselves far from the Granite State and in need of local assistance.   
Commissioner Starks, can you speak to how the FCC is working to address this 
issue and what more needs to be done?   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  Thank you so much for the question.  Thank you for your 
leadership and hard work on this critical issue.   
It has been just about 2 years now that 988 has been up and running, and we 
continue to build on that tremendous success.  Nearly 10 million calls that we have had.  We continue to make sure that folks that are dealing with this life crisis have a place that they can call.   
And so, to your point, making sure that they can interact with a local counselor is 
something that we have heard from mental health advocates, and that is where we are pushing for our policymaking to go.   
The last thing that I would say is just it has been such a cooperative effort 
between industry, mental health, HHS, SAMHSA.  Everybody here has been working so hard together for the American people that are in crisis this way.   
Ms. Kuster.   And do you think there is some kind of option where they could say 
where their location is and it wouldn't just be driven by the area code?  Is that something being sorted out?   
Mr. Starks.   It would not be driven by the area code.  It would be based upon --  
Ms. Kuster.   GPS or --   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 Mr. Starks.   -- where the cell phone is pinging off of.  
Ms. Kuster.   Okay.  Great.  That is very helpful.  Thank you so much, and we 
look forward to working with you.   
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, as Congress works to restore the FCC's spectrum 
auction authority, can you explain what role the FCC plays in setting technical rules for 
particular spectrum bands, and are there specific factors that Congress should keep in mind?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I think our record on this is extraordinary.  We are the first 
country in the world to auction off airwaves.  We are the first country in the world to hold incentive auctions.  We are the first country in the world to have creative dynamic sharing systems to allow for hierarchies of spectrum rights.  We are the first country in the world to take garbage unused spectrum and turn it into unlicensed airwaves which are used for WiFi.  In other words, the record of the United States and the FCC to take airwaves and put them to market is second to none.   
The challenge we face going forward is there are more things we are connecting 
wirelessly -- more people, more places, more things  -- and the reality is we are going to 
need more spectrum to continue to fuel that.   
So what we will need from Congress is renewing that spectrum authority, and we 
will need some details on which bands you think we should approach next and convert perhaps from Federal use to new commercial use.   
Ms. Kuster.   Great.  Very helpful.  Thank you.   
I will just close by saying, broadband is an essential service in today's digital world, 
and I appreciate all of the work that you all are doing to make it more accessible and affordable for our constituents.  Thank you so much.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

[12:00 p.m.]  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady yields back.  
And the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Tennessee's First District for 
5 minutes for questions.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you witnesses for being 
here today.   
You know, the First District of Tennessee is home to a large amount of Federal 
land, specifically the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Cherokee National 
Forest.  And updating wireless internet infrastructure on Federal lands is currently bogged down in the red tape of NEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act.  And I can tell you firsthand, some of the most difficult places in my district to get quality service is going to be the Great Smoky Mountains and the Cherokee National Forest.  And that 
is just hurting our communities.   
In February, I introduced the Wireless Broadband Competition and Efficient 
Deployment Act, which would roll back the red tape, keeping these communities on 
Federal lands from getting the infrastructure to stay connected.   
And my question is for you, Commissioner Carr.  How important is it for Congress 
to take an active role in turning down these barriers to broadband deployment like 
overburdensome and sometimes ridiculous permitting requirements?   
Mr. Carr.   Thanks, Congresswoman, for your leadership, particularly on Federal 
lands, where it simply takes too long and costs too much to build out.  I was just on 
another national park myself last week, Shenandoah.  And I had virtually no cell phone This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
79 
 service.  In fact, I had to climb this small little tower to get any service at all.  I ended 
up climbing that mountain a lot, fairly addicted to the internet.  And so I think we need 
to move forward with legislation and leadership that you are showing and generally 
taking a look at permitting reform.   
Look, we have been spending a lot of money, $800 billion, again by my count; $42 
billion if you look at BEAD.  But we are not streamlining permitting.  That is just like stepping on the gas and the brakes at the same time.  We have got to get serious about the types of reforms that you have been leading on.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  
Let me follow up with another question for you, Commissioner Carr.  There is 
general acceptance of the security risk posed by reliance on China to power U.S. communications.  Are you at all concerned that these Chinese -made communication 
chips may create vulnerabilities or security concerns for the U.S.?   
Mr. Carr.   Yeah.  Look, I think when you look at the CCP, they aren't just simply 
coming at us through one vector, even one technology vector.  It is a 1,000 different things that they are doing to try to prod and exploit vulnerabilities.  We have taken action on the device layer, Huawei, ZTE, at the carrier level, China Mobile, but there is more to do, including data centers as well.   
Your point about chips is exactly right, and I think that can help feed into our 
proposal to look at labs and certification bodies that are going to be reviewing the 
components to make sure that those labs are themselves trustworthy.  But we need to 
sort of play defense across all of these different areas of technology, because we are getting prodded by the CCP across all of them.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   You don't have to tell me anything.  That is nothing new.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
80 
 So I guess another question, you can answer it, Commissioner Carr.  What 
methodologies can the FCC or other Federal agencies deploy to ensure that broadband 
programs are making accessible connected devices that are verified and can be trusted?  
It leads into what you just said.  
Mr. Carr.   One thing that we can do is complete our proceeding that is looking at 
these TCBs in labs.  I think another step that I have called for is for the FCC to look at the entities we do regulate and prohibit them from interconnecting with insecure entities, including China Mobile and China Telecom, to the extent that they are not even offering 
necessarily Title I or Title II services.  I think that is one thing that the FCC should be 
doing.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   Yeah, no joke.  
In the past year, the FCC has adopted rules governing broadband labels, digital 
discrimination, net neutrality, and data breaches.  And you are considering more rules in these areas and in other areas, like outage reporting.   
So my question is, can a company with 20, 30, 50 employees really keep up with 
all of this without significant burdens to that company?  We want them to survive, but how can they do that?   
Mr. Carr.   I think what people lose sight of is that the broadband builders in this 
country that are truly bridging the digital divide in rural communities, it is not these large corporate behemoths.  In many cases, it is mom -and-pop operations, small 20 -person 
operations, and they are confronting a regulatory onslaught from Washington.  We need to sort of decrease that regulation and that will help unleash their ability to build.   
Look, they are already dealing with inflation, they are already dealing with high 
fuel prices.  And on top of that we are raising the regulatory cost.  Again, BEAD I think This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
81 
 is a perfect example where the Biden administration is layering on all of these regulatory 
costs that Congress specifically either prohibited them from doing or didn't authorize 
them to do.  And price controls is a piece of that.   
Right now, the administration is holding up applications from Tennessee and from 
other States.  We just got a letter from Tennessee saying that the Biden administration 
is compelling them to engage in price controls and rate regulation as a condition to getting the money that they are owed through BEAD.  That is just unnecessarily slowing things down in addition to being bad policy.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   So you agree, decrease the permitting regulations and just 
regulations in general.  Okay, I agree.   
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas' 33rd District for 5  minutes of 
questions.  
Mr. Veasey.   Thank you, Chairman Latta.   
And I want to thank the commissioners for being here again.  It probably will not 
come as a surprise to some of the commissioners on the panel that I want to talk with you today about ACP and about the fact that ACP has lowered internet bills for 23 million American families, which I think is great, because I represent a district in the Dallas -Fort 
Worth area that is largely lower income.  And I also think that it is great too for my 
Republican colleagues, because the data shows that in rural areas that they represent, 
that even more people have signed up for ACP.  And so I think that it has been a win -win 
for people all around the country.   
And we all know that the expiration of the ACP is an issue that is really going to This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
82 
 hurt these 23 million families, and I am very concerned about that.  Also concerned 
about the fact that Republican leadership hasn't advanced any legislation whatsoever for 
their rural constituents or the constituents that I represent to make sure that this lifeline 
doesn't expire.  And as a result, funding ran out in June, and prices have gone up for nearly about 70,000 people in the district that I represent just in the Dallas -Fort Worth 
area.  So imagine, again, how that impacts people from all around the country.   
And so I have a question for Chairwoman Rosenworcel.  Has the FCC heard 
directly from impacted consumers that are having to navigate this new post -ACP world?  
I was wondering if you could kind of weigh in on that.  And Commissioner Starks and Gomez are also welcome to join in.  Thank you.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah, we have heard from lots and lots of consumers.  We 
have seen a 40  percent increase in the number of complaints about billing and charges 
related to ACP.  These are people who are angry, upset, and bewildered by the fact this program has come to an end.  They are from rural America, urban America, and 
everything in between.  A disproportionate number of them are elderly, single parents, 
and retired military.  And we have got heartbreaking emails that come to my inbox every day.   
And I know that Commissioner Starks and Commissioner Gomez spoke eloquently 
about this in their statements, so I would love it if they would continue the discussion.  
Mr. Starks.   Yes, thank you.  Agree with all that.  You know, the numbers 
simply show that one in six households in America are enrolled.  That is a big number.  That is impacting a lot of folks.   
One thing that I would like to highlight for you, Congressman.  One of the 
initiatives that I had was Your Home, Your Internet, making sure that those that were in This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
83 
 Federal housing assistance, HUD housing, Section 8 housing, that they knew about the 
program, they automatically were qualified.  When I started that initiative, about 
500,000 eligible households were enrolled.  After the momentum that the FCC gained 
on it, nearly 2 million at the time of the freeze were enrolled.  So it is a real number of folks that started to know about the program, see what it could benefit for them for telehealth, telemedicine, for young learners.  And So I wanted to highlight that in the work that we have done coordinating with HUD, which is extraordinarily important.  
Ms. Gomez.   Thank you, Congressman.  And by the way, thank you for the call 
as well.  I enjoyed speaking with you very much.  
I absolutely agree with everything that the chairwoman and Commissioner Starks 
have said.  We are hearing from consumers, heartbreaking emails that we get from them just about every day.   
In addition, when we go visit localities, we hear from parents who are extremely 
worried about how they are going to afford connectivity for their children.  We hear 
from seniors who are relying on the ACP in order to maintain connections.  And we hear 
from the veterans.  This is both urban and rural areas nationwide, so it is a significant problem.   
And as I mentioned earlier, I have lived with not having the resources to pay my 
bills and having to make the difficult decision between paying for food or paying for a phone bill.  And this was before connectivity became so crucial to our daily lives.  So 
this is a significant issue, and thank you for your leadership.  
Mr. Veasey.   Yeah.  No, absolutely.  And I also wanted to ask you all, if 
Congress is able to fund the ACP before the end of July, can the program be restarted 
using possible bridge funding of $7 billion to $8 billion?  And do you think it also makes This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
84 
 sense to include ACP in an update to the USF?   
Ms. Gomez.   Thank you for that question.   
First of all, I very much encourage the efforts on updating the USF.  We want to 
make sure that it is sustainable.  And putting ACP as part of the USF funding would make 
it sustainable as well and then we wouldn't have to have these conversations every few months.  
Mr. Veasey.   Yeah.  
Ms. Gomez.   To answer your first question, bridge funding would certainly be 
helpful.  And if Congress passed it by the end of July, I would probably come here and do cartwheels.  
Mr. Veasey.   Thank you very much.   
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
Mr. Latta.   Well, thank you very much.  The gentleman yields back.  
And the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Iowa for 5  minutes for 
questions.  
Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   Thank you, Chair Latta and Ranking Member Matsui, for 
holding this hearing today.  And I want to also thank the witnesses for testifying before this committee.   
I am hearing some very harsh language from the other side of the aisle; perhaps if 
we prioritized our spending we wouldn't be worried about whether or not we get the 
money.  But all I know is rampant $1.9 trillion COVID spending at the beginning of this 
Biden -Harris administration led to rampant inflation, which has led to 20  percent cost 
increases and has led to record high interest rates which are really challenging everybody.  And having grown up in a very humble family, having to decide whether or not I could This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
85 
 afford food or something else very necessary, I know those challenges.   
Commission Carr, in your testimony, you stated that the BEAD initiative is the 
slowest moving Federal broadband deployment program in recent history.  Specifically, 
$42 billion program, 967  days since it was signed into law, not one person, home, or 
business has been connected to the internet with these dollars.  No construction projects will even start, according to the President, until 2025 and many in 2026.   
Can you explain how the Biden -Harris administration's decision to add additional 
red tape is causing unnecessary delays and jeopardizing the program?   
Mr. Carr.   Thank you for the question.   
I will start with your point about ACP and spending.  Look, the FCC did its own 
survey, and it found that, of this $17 billion, only 15  percent of people said that they 
would lose internet service if the program expired.  So I think as people in Congress focus on ACP, let's focus on the 15  percent, or whatever number really needs it, rather 
than simply pouring more money into that existing program in its current form.  
With respect to BEAD, $42 billion and a promise to connect millions of Americans, 
and 967  days later not even a shovel worth of dirt has been turned.  Some people have 
said we should measure that program by its intention to connect millions of Americans.  I think we should measure it based on its results, and right now, it is off the rails.  We are looking at DEI requirements, climate change requirements, price controls.  Right now, the Biden administration is going back and forth with Virginia that wants the money 
to move forward, saying, you didn't put enough of a thumb on the scale for a price 
control, please rewrite it this way.  The same thing with Tennessee.   
So rather than staying laser- focused on just getting Americans across the digital 
divide, we are wasting time on things that have nothing to do with connecting them.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
86 
 Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   Do you think the program will be a success, more 
importantly?  And then, how do we define success?  To me, it should be defined by the 
number of households, the number of businesses that have been connected.  
Mr. Carr.   I think BEAD is a program that is worth fighting for, but it needs a 
course correction.  We can still do it.  Let's stop trying to pursue DEI and just bridge the 
digital divide.  Let's stop pushing these climate change agendas and just connect communities.  If we can do those things and get rid of the extraneous political improvising, I think this program will get closer to getting back on track.  
Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   Commissioner Simington, you indicated in your testimony 
that the Universal Service Fund is in urgent need of reform.  How would you reform the USF both in terms of distribution and contributions?   
Mr. Simington.   Absolutely.  So the Universal Service Fund, of course, dates 
back to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, at a time when the landline market was a lot bigger than it is now.  Thus, on the front end of contributions, it is very difficult to 
fund a growing program out of a shrinking base.   
Now, if you look at what the landline network was supposed to do, universal 
service says it was supposed to connect all Americans in a single network.  In fact, it was 
to be a network that was intercompatible with all the networks worldwide and, thus, it benefited from the network effects of scale.  Today, the beneficiaries of the networks effects of scale are online companies primarily.  So to put it another way, when Comcast 
gains a customer, it is not just Comcast; it is Google, it is Meta, it is Amazon.  These are 
the companies that benefit even more from universal connectivity than individual network operators who do not have the same advantages of scale.  
Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   How would you change that?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
87 
 Mr. Simington.   Well, I think by contribution reform, we would say that the main 
beneficiaries of these network effects should be considered as contributors.  
Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   Thank you.   
And lastly, more of a comment, because I think this question has been asked and 
answered, but in agricultural heavy States like Iowa, the advancement of precision 
agriculture is essential for our farmers to remain competitive and efficient.  Widespread and ubiquitous either broadband or wireless coverage.  And I have been in the combine with farmers who are using  -- or use Starlink.  I have visited with our manufacturers as 
well.  It is really important for the adoption and importation of precision agriculture technologies, which would meet some of those sustainability goals that you are trying to implement.  And I would just encourage the FCC to expand and enhance wireless availability, as was mentioned earlier, to meet the growing demands, but also to ensure that the BEAD program is put in place and enacted, and let the providers get to do the work that they do because they are extraordinarily frustrated in my State.   
And then, a question for the record.  Chairman Rosenworcel, answer a question 
for the record, we would just like to ask what the FCC's role is in spectrum studies that NTIA is leading.   
With that, I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady yields back.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida's Ninth District for 5  minutes

Mr. Soto.   Thank you, Chairman.

 going through our committee as we speak, and all require high -speed internet; 
connections that we need to make sure every American has to flourish.   
On the $42 billion fund for high- speed internet, as well as the $14.2  billion 
Affordable Connectivity Program, both are part of making this access available to 
everyone, especially in rural areas.  I have both urban, suburban, and rural in our district.  And the FCC, you all stand at the vanguard of this progress.  The only complaints I hear back home from local folks is it is not happening fast enough and that the Affordable Connectivity Program ran out.  
Commissioner Gomez, thank you so much for coming to the district, to the 
Orlando VA, and speaking with local veterans, including many disabled, wounded warriors.  And as you mentioned, 80  percent of medical treatments our veterans are 
undertaking require broadband connection.  And ACP has provided benefits to 79,000 households in my district and has reduced cost by $37 million.   
And so can you expand on the importance you think the ACP program plays, 
especially in healthcare and for our veterans?   
Ms. Gomez.   Thank you, Congressman, for that question.  And thank you again 
for the visit in Orlando at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  It was really interesting, and I really appreciated hearing directly from beneficiaries of the Affordable Connectivity Program.  
As you mentioned, 80  percent of healthcare from that medical center requires a 
connection to broadband.  And we heard from so many folks during that visit about the importance of connectivity and the ways that it actually saves costs for these very veterans, particularly veterans with disabilities.  If they need to go to a hearing in order  -- for their benefits, before they had broadband connectivity, they would have to This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

89 
 get in the car or a van, drive for hours, get a hotel room for at least a couple of days, in 
order just to be able to attend the hearing.  Now they can do it online, and that saves 
them costs, it saves the government costs.  So that is just one example of the things that 
we heard when we were visiting with the VA center.  
Mr. Soto.   Thank you.  
Commissioner  Starks, as you may know, I filed the Launch Communications Act 
again.  It has passed the House again.  We appreciate the Commission's important work on the issue of ensuring greater spectrum for launches.  We had 73 last year, we 
will have over 100 this year, and the weather doesn't always cooperate.  So really 
important that we continue streamlining this process.   
Can you please discuss the need to expand the amount of spectrum that is 
available for commercial space launches and reentries and the importance of streamlining the process for accessing spectrum for this use?   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  It has been -- thank you for your longstanding work here.  It 
has been extremely important.   
We are seeing more launches than ever.  We need to keep pace with the 
technology, keep pace with innovation.  And we have been able to with the Space Bureau here, now be able to move quicker, be able to be more nimble.  And it has been more important than ever as we are getting more and more connectivity and more of what satellite is going to look like.  
Mr. Soto.   Chair Rosenworcel, first of all, I am sorry for your loss, and welcome 
back to the committee.  I am excited about the competition we are seeing in the satellite market.  We are launching so many of the Starlink satellites, and Kuiper Belt is about to come up as well, to expand both satellite internet as well and from low Earth This is an unedited transcript.

 orbit.   
What can the Congress do to make sure the United States continues to lead in 
building a competitive and dynamic space marketplace?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, thank you.  I know that Kennedy Space Center and 
Cape Canaveral are in your backyard.  And I had the privilege of going there last year 
and meeting with the Artemis 2 astronauts.  And it really is an out of this world experience what is happening.   
We have had, nationally, more than 200 space launches in the last year.  It is no 
longer occasional.  We have built the biggest commercial space industry in the world.  And to the extent that this is a budget hearing, let me be clear, we need more resources for our Space Bureau.  You want us to process this faster and make sure we continue to lead the world?  That is part of the ways to do it.   
I mean, we have got tens of thousands of satellite applications sitting before us 
right now.  Everything we can do to get more engineers, economists, and policy experts 
to review that, be thoughtful about it, and engage with our global counterparts is 
valuable and it is valuable for our geopolitical leadership.  
Mr. Soto.   And I second that, Madam Chairwoman.  
I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   The gentleman's time has expired.   
And the chair now recognizes the gentleman from Idaho's First District for 5 
minutes of questions.  
Mr. Fulcher.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
Mr. Carr, I paid particular attention to your comments just a few minutes ago 
regarding the importance in the beneficial aspects of speeding up the process of approval This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 across Federal lands with NEPA, National Historic Preservation Act.  And I actually have 
legislation that would do that, and that is in the works.  So, hopefully, that will make 
some headway with that.   
But in a previous conversation, you had talked about a Federal Lands Desk, if I 
recall correctly, and the possibility of a conduit there that might speed things up.  And 
so this was not part of my original line of questioning, but is there anything further  -- it 
has been a while since this conversation has taken place  -- is there anything 
further  -- further developments on this, on the Federal Lands Desk, or is this something 
that we need to take further steps for here?   
Mr. Carr.   I think we need to continue to move forward.  There are a lot of 
infrastructure ideas that we can do.  For instance, we streamlined a lot of rules at the FCC that apply to small cells, just one type of technology.  We need to extend those to more technologies, and the Federal Lands Desk I think would help as well, because Congress has taken a lot of stabs at streamlining the permitting process for Federal lands, 
but a lot of these agencies, like Forest and otherwise, they have important day jobs as 
well and they just don't get around to this quickly enough.   
So I think if we had a place at the FCC where folks could come and help dislodge 
some of those applications, I think it could be helpful.   
Mr. Fulcher.   So it is particularly pertinent to my State.  We have got two -thirds 
of land mass, approximately, where that is an issue.   
I have also heard about backlogs as a concern, specifically within BLM for service.  
Are you hearing anything like that that might be slowing down the process or the channels?   
Mr. Carr.   We hear about this constantly.  I visited places all across the West This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 where you will go to a laydown yard, an outdoor warehouse, and they will have, you 
know, multiple antennas sitting there, many, many miles of conduit sitting there.  So the 
hard part of, like, getting all that equipment out there and purchasing it is done, they are 
not just sitting there waiting on approvals from the government to get out there and build it.  And I think that is a real big problem.   
The further West you go, the higher percentage of Federal lands.  If you pick a 
spot to build and it just happens to be Federal lands, it can take you two times longer than if that plot of land happened to be privately owned.  We have got to close that gap.  
Mr. Fulcher.   Appreciate that.   
Commissioner Rosenworcel, do you want to comment on that?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  I just want to acknowledge this is a good point.  
Across the country, about one -third of our land is owned by Federal authorities.  It is the 
least built out land when it comes to communications.  And I believe it was in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act that Congress required the GSA to set up a 
uniform form for all of our Federal agencies when a provider wants to approach them 
because they want some construction.  I think that form is called Form 299.   
But the deadlines on that form are long.  They can take 270  days to respond.  
Just to be clear, the FCC's deadlines for States and localities are 90  days and 150  days.  I 
think we should expect a faster response time from our Federal authorities, and I would encourage you to you look into the status of Form 299.  
Mr. Fulcher.   Appreciate that.  Appreciate that very much.  Thank you.  
I would like to shift gears just a little bit.  This has been touched on as well, but I 
hear feedback on it.  I want to ask Commissioner Carr if he can expound on this a little bit.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
93 
 This is regarding the effect of the Title II proposal, and the impacts on small and 
rural providers.  We have a lot of those in my State, but I am hearing the possibility of 
price controls.  That is a concern in the industry.  And the potential impact on these 
smaller and rural providers, I want to get your feedback on that.  Is that a real concern?  And what should we be doing about this?   
Mr. Carr.   Thanks.  I think price controls as a policy matter is the absolute wrong 
direction, because we need to be attracting billions of dollars across the country into these networks.  And there is a risk out there.  The FCC in its Digital Equity Order opens 
the door to rate regulations at the Federal level, even though it disavows it in the 
separate Title II decision.  But you are seeing a number of States, New York being an example, that are trying to impose price controls on their own.   
Similarly, you see the Commerce Department, the Biden administration pressuring 
States  -- Virginia is one example, Tennessee is another -- to adopt price controls, even 
though the law that you pass here in Congress told Commerce Department no rate 
regulations.  So there certainly is this latent and growing effort to impose it, and it is a 
policy and legal mistake as well.  
Mr. Fulcher.   Thank you for that.  
Chairman Rosenworcel, this has got to be really quick, and I can follow up with a 
written question as well.  But can you speak very quickly to the possibility of improving the process of adding entities to the FCC's covered list?   
Mr. Latta.   And again, the gentleman's time has expired.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  The authority was given by Congress to other 
agencies.  I can follow up with you on that.  I would happy to work with you to  --  
Mr. Fulcher.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
94 
 Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The time of the gentleman has expired.  
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from the Seventh District in Texas for 5 
minutes of questions.  
Mrs. Fletcher.   Thank you so much, Chairman Latta, and thank you, Ranking 
Member Matsui, for convening today's hearing.   
And thank you to our commissioners for being here to testify about the FCC and 
the many important issues under its jurisdiction.   
And as many of you, I think probably everyone here has seen, Hurricane Beryl hit 
the Texas Gulf Coast yesterday with my hometown of Houston right in the path of the 
storm, when this Category 1 hurricane made landfall yesterday and made it right through Houston and our area.  As of last night, there were 2.2  million people without power, 
including at my own home.  
And I know that our folks on the ground are working as hard and as quickly as 
possible to restore power and to restore communications.  And I have spoken with a lot 
of our local communications providers who have established backup power sources to 
make sure that my constituents don't lose their ability to be in contact with emergency responders, with family, with friends, and to try to make sure that they can get through the storm during this emergency.   
So, Chairwoman Rosenworcel, I really want to thank you and thank all of your 
colleagues for the Mandatory Disaster Response Initiative, MDRI.  And for those who 
don't know, these are new rules that took effect in May  -- just in May  -- that wireless 
providers take certain actions to improve and reduce the impact of wireless outages and 
support faster service restoration during emergencies like this one.  It has been absolutely critical that people have been able to be in contact.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
95 
 And, you know, one of the actions, of course, is requiring backup power sources 
for cell sites and infrastructure, and that has proved to be very important, as I really 
haven't had trouble reaching people, other than that they maybe can't keep their devices 
powered.  So those are huge challenges.  And I know that in response to Beryl, the FCC announced the activation of the Disaster Information Reporting System and for the first time this mandatory initiative.  
So, Chairwoman Rosenworcel, with the time that we have, can you just talk a little 
bit about why it was important for the FCC to move this from a voluntary program to a 
mandatory program?  And maybe just explain a little bit about what that will mean for 
my constituents, what some of the actions are that are required, and how in moments like this where we are really in crisis how your agency is working to help make sure that 
we have the resources and information that we need to stay in communication.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  Thank you.   
Everyone needs communication, and especially in crisis.  And, unfortunately, the 
Texas Gulf Coast has had more than its fair share of weather events, and as a result, we started the disaster system that takes in data about when services are down.  We also sent individuals down to the Houston area to work with FEMA on this.  We have a lot of people who do that work, they do it quietly.  They are real heroes.  They go and get some ground troops throughout the state of communications and help with restoration.   
And we also have a first test case of our Mandatory Disaster Response Initiative 
which requires carriers to work with one another and let their customers roam on each other's networks.  This was previously a volunteer initiative, but I went with Commissioner Carr after Hurricane Ida to Louisiana.  We spoke with a lot of public safety officials, and they convinced us both that this should be required.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
96 
 So after Hurricane Beryl leaves the Houston area, one thing we are going to do is 
find out how it worked, because we want to make sure it works for everyone going 
forward.  This is both a tragedy, but I think it is also an opportunity.  I think you are 
going to be able to demonstrate to us how our carriers worked with one another and kept people connected.  
Mrs. Fletcher.   Well, thank you so much for that.  And I have a little bit more 
time, so I also want to ask, one of the challenges we are seeing is, of course, keeping track of outages of all kinds, including the power outages.  But also, I know that the agency 
recently issued an order classifying broadband as Title II service that will give the FCC 
insight into network outages, and that will ultimately, I think, benefit people in my district and across the country.   
Can you just talk a little bit more about what that will mean?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  When broadband goes out, a community goes down.  
When it goes out in my house, you know, my children are ready for revolution.  It is one 
of those circumstances that affects everything in modern life.  It is why the Federal 
Communications Commission needs the authority to collect data about outages, not just in the aftermath of weather disasters, but also outages that occur when we least expect them.   
There was a community in Michigan that lost service during the pandemic for 
45 days, but the FCC had no data or information about it.  Now that we have Title II 
authority back, we will be able to collect information about outages, understand why they occur, and then take action to prevent them from occurring again, which is really, really important for all of us who count on the internet in our day -to-day life.  
Mrs. Fletcher.   Well, thank you so much for that.  And I am glad to hear about This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
97 
 how the commissioners are working together in this instance.   
I don't have time for another question, but with the 10  seconds I have left, I don't 
think I can close without mentioning my surprise that FCC officials that are nominated by 
the President and confirmed by the Senate are listed as contributors to the Project 2025 plan, which is really a blueprint for dismantling our government and eviscerating agencies like this one and others and fundamentally changing our country.  So I am surprised and very disappointed to see that.   
And with that, I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Florida's Third District for 5  minutes 
for questioning.  
Mrs. Cammack.   Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you to our 
commissioners for appearing before us here today.  
I will start with you, Chairwoman.  In June, the chairman of the Federal Elections 
Commission sent you a letter regarding the FCC proposed regulations on AI and political advertisements.  Now, in the letter, Chairman Cooksey stated that the FCC lacks the legal authority to promulgate conflicting disclaimers requirements only for political communication.  He also stated that it would create confusion and disarray among political campaigns.   
Now, have you spoken to Chair Cooksey about this proposal, and do you plan to 
move forward following the FEC's concerns about the authority and political speech?   
And I apologize, I am in three conflicting hearings today, so if this has been asked, 
I appreciate you answering it again.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   First of all, I believe in transparency.  I believe every single This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
98 
 consumer should know if AI is being used.  I think it is good for truth, honesty, and 
safety that every single one of us knows if AI is being used.   
I spoke to the vice chair of the FEC who thinks that we have complementary 
authority here, because since 1930, the FCC has been requiring campaigns, when they advertise on television and radio, to file with us what ad they put up, when it ran, and how much they paid for it.   
In 1974, Congress --  
Mrs. Cammack.   No, wait.  Chairwoman?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   -- asked cable authorities to do that.  And then in 1992 --   
Mrs. Cammack.   I asked if you spoke with the chair, not the vice chair.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I have only spoken to the vice chair, but the truth is we have a 
long history.   
Mrs. Cammack.   So the chair and the vice chair have differing opinions on this.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Since 1930, we have been collecting this data in our files.  
Mrs. Cammack.   I am not trying to be adversarial.  I am just trying to get to the 
bottom of this.   
So there is a --  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Okay.  Fair.  So I have spoken to the vice chair --  
Mrs. Cammack.   There is a disconnect between the chair and the vice chair over 
at the FEC.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  They have a difference of opinion.  The vice chair 
says that, clearly, we have complementary authority in this area.  I agree with that.  
Mrs. Cammack.   So what is the plan, because we are less than 5  months out from 
a significant election?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
99 
 Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  Totally.  I agree with you, but what I have 
proposed  --  
Mrs. Cammack.   All of us being candidates, in addition  --  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Let's talk about what I proposed, because I feel like this 
conversation isn't about that.  What I have proposed is a rulemaking, a proposal that we 
collect public comment on whether or not advertisements that are run on our televisions and radios should just disclose if they use AI.  
Mrs. Cammack.   I think  --  
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady is asking a question.  
Mrs. Cammack.   Yes.  I don't think that that requires a whole comment period 
because, by and large, everyone wants transparency, right?  It is a matter of does the FCC have authority to do so.   
So, Commission Carr -- 
Ms. Rosenworcel.   We have laws since 19  --  
Mr. Latta.   No.  The gentlelady from Florida has the floor to ask.   
Mr. Carr.   The proposal that would have the FCC mark a monumental sea change 
in the regulation of political speech on the eve of a national election is as unlawful as it is misguided.  As the chairman of the FEC has made clear, Congress has given them exclusive authority with respect to disclosures involving political ads.  Moreover, the FCC can only muddy the waters here.  It would put in place a proposal that applies only to an 
ad on broadcast TV, but you could see the same ad online or on cable that wouldn't have 
the disclosure.  That is going to leave consumers less informed, perhaps more confused than they are today.   
So I think the FCC should abandon this proposal because it can only move forward This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
100  
 right on the eve of an election.  This is an important debate, the use of AI, no doubt, but 
that debate should be happening here in Congress, and it is happening at the FEC as well.  
It is just not a job for the FCC right now.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I don't know why we are so scared of --  
Mrs. Cammack.   I am sorry, I have to  -- I have to reclaim my time.   
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady from Florida is asking the questions and has the floor.  
Mrs. Cammack.   Chairwoman, I have got to jump to another issue.   
Thank you, Commissioner Carr, for that feedback.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   No problem.  
Mrs. Cammack.   The 4.9 gigahertz band, as we know, very, very important, first 
responders public safety.  I want to get to a timeline for making a decision on whether 
this band will be reallocated to FirstNet or it will be auctioned.  Do we have that?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   We have an open docket on that.  We are taking in comment 
from all kinds of public safety authorities right now.  To be clear, it is not a question of 
whether it will go to FirstNet or be auctioned.  It is a question of what public safety 
authorities might be managing these airwaves going forward.  
Mrs. Cammack.   Timeline?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   My hope is that we can do this within the next several 
months, but, boy, lots of people are filing a lot of stuff before us.  And when it comes at us fast and furious, we have to spend some time looking at it and reading it carefully.   
Mrs. Cammack.   There is a lot more that I wish I could get to.  I wish you guys 
could see my notes here, or maybe not, I am not sure.  But I want to leave us in the last 22 seconds with this.  
I agree with you, Commissioner Carr, that this could severely muddy the waters This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
101  
 when we are talking about AI.  While I agree wholeheartedly that we need transparency 
and clarity about the use of AI in political advertisements, the FEC has jurisdiction over 
this issue.  And the fact that there are divided opinions, conflicting opinions within the 
FCC, that you have not spoken to the chair of the FEC, is concerning.   
So with that, my time has expired.  And, Mr. Chairman, I yield.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady's time has expired.   
And the chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York, who is waiving on to 
the subcommittee, who is a member of the full committee.  
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you, Chair Latta and Ranking Member Matsui, for holding this 
hearing, and the chair and commissioners for your service in being here today.   
Before I go on with my questioning, Chair Rosenworcel, I think you wanted to 
make a statement in response to the AI issue yet.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I just think transparency is a good thing, disclosing when AI 
use is a good thing.  And the FCC has authority in this area and has had authority since 
the 1930s.  
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you.   
Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have championed efforts to extend 
broadband access to unserved and underserved areas.  Last Congress, I was proud to 
support the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocated over $42 billion for high -speed 
broadband deployment nationwide.  With these historic investments, accurate 
broadband maps are essential for the equitable and effective allocation of Federal funds.   
Chairman Rosenworcel, I appreciated your work on behalf of my district, visiting 
the district and listening carefully to what my constituents had to say about this issue.  
And I appreciate your written testimony on the National Broadband Map, and commend This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
102  
 the FCC for the substantial progress made in updating these maps over the past few 
years.  However, in the Capital Region of New York, we are still seeing the effects of 
unreliable data.   
Communities often struggle with slow speeds, unreliable connections, or no 
service, despite being designated as having access.  This disparity can hamper economic 
development and perpetuate systemic inequalities, widening the digital divide.   
So can you speak please, Commissioner Chair, to  -- can you speak to how the FCC 
is incorporating consumer- reported data on broadband availability and quality into its 
mapping efforts and the role public feedback plays in efforts to refine our broadband maps?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  Public feedback is so important.  We built maps 
based on the Broadband DATA Act, which is bipartisan work of this committee.  Those maps are light years ahead of anything we have ever had before, and they are iterative.  They are improving all the time.   
The primary way that they improve is when consumers and State and local 
officials go on to that website and register a complaint or a criticism that says, you say there is service here, I am standing right in that location and, no, there is not.  And so I would encourage you to encourage your constituents to work with that map.  And I would be happy to set up times for them to discuss it with our broadband mapping team, because I know feedback from local individuals is the way we get this data right.  
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you so much.  And can you discuss how the FCC collaborates 
with other Federal agencies, State governments, and industry stakeholders to streamline broadband mapping efforts and ensure a cohesive approach to improving nationwide broadband access?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
103  
 Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  It is a really, really big task, to be candid with you.  
When I got to the agency and I took over, one of the first things I did was said, okay, we 
are going to do better maps.  And then I studied it and I instantly know, understood why 
nobody had done it before.   
We had to build a data set of tax records, property records, satellite images that 
indicated where every single household is in the United States.  And then we had to build a system that was capable of taking in data from all of our carriers, and then feedback and crowdsourced information from local, State, Tribal, and consumers all 
telling us, what is going on.   
The system right now is terrific.  We have got 115 million households that we 
indicate where broadband is.  We know that in 6 million of them it is not present.  But 
it can always be improved.  That is why we update it every 6  months.  And coming out 
this week, in fact, is another rulemaking from the FCC that all my colleagues supported which asks questions about how we improve this process further to make sure we take 
into account smarter approaches to things like fixed wireless and technologies that may 
not have been at the forefront when the Broadband DATA Act was passed by this committee.  
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you.  Additionally, earlier this year, I was pleased to see your 
proposal to improve routing for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.  As a co -lead of the 
bipartisan 988 lifeline improvement act, I am committed to ensuring that callers in crisis 
receive access to locally relevant mental health resources.   
In May, the KFF released an analysis of the utilization of the 988 Suicide and Crisis 
Lifeline's LGBTQ service showing that 10  percent of all 988 outreach was made via the 
LGBTQ service, but only 20  percent of LGBTQ adults were even aware of the 988 service.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
104  
 So could you discuss any initiatives the FCC is undertaking to raise public 
awareness about the availability and purpose of 988, especially among vulnerable 
populations that may benefit most from the service?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  Well, first things first, we are seeing substantial 
increases in the use of 988, the simple three -digit number.  More people understand it, 
more people know about it.  We are getting many more calls than we previously did 
under the 10 -digit number that was hard for folks to remember.   
We are going to have to work on publicizing it with mental health authorities.  
My colleagues and I have a lot of skills, but we are not mental health experts, so we have been coordinating with the Health and Human Services Department and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services agency there.  And going forward, we are going to work with them to make sure that calls are georouted; in other words, we get information off the cell tower so that when we send that 988 caller to a help center, they will be sent to assistance that is nearby.   
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you so much.   
And, Mr.  Chair, I yield back.  
Mr. Obernolte.   [Presiding.]  The gentleman yields back.   
I will recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions.   
Chair Rosenworcel, it is very nice to see you again.  I would like to continue a line 
of questioning that was started by my colleague from Florida, Mrs. Cammack, about the 
FCC's recent actions to put restrictions on the use of AI in political advertising.   
And to be clear, I don't think anyone disagrees with the importance of putting 
some guidelines in place.  I think everyone is disturbed by the thought that a campaign 
could run an ad with their opponent saying or doing something that they didn't actually This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
105  
 do with the use of AI to make that happen.  But we want to make sure that we get this 
done in the appropriate way.   
And Mrs. Cammack highlighted the fact that the chair of the FEC has objected to 
the FCC's use of your regulatory authority to do this, and so I just wanted to ask a couple questions about that.   
If the FCC has authority over broadcast television, so, ostensibly, if you 
implemented this rule, you could require a disclaimer on ads on broadcast, but could you require that same disclaimer on other channels, such as streaming services or social 
media?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   To be clear, Congress has given us this authority for 
broadcast, radio, satellite, and cable.  That is a substantial portion of campaign ads.  
And we have exercised this authority as far back as 1938.  So this is the system everyone has used for decades.  Every single campaign reports when an ad was run, who paid for it.  And on air they say who is responsible for it.  So we are just behind this principle of 
transparency, which is you should simply say if AI was used.  It is nothing more 
complicated than that.  We are proposing transparency.  It is very simple.  Was AI used, yes or no?   
Mr. Obernolte.   Sure.  I understand that.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   And separately, though, I want to just make one more point.  
We have these files for Federal, State, local, and issues.  In other words, it is a far 
greater community than what the Federal Election Commission oversees.  That is why 
the vice chair said we have complementary authorities in this area, and I agree.  
Mr. Obernolte.   So here is a concern that I have, which is that if the FCC imposes 
this requirement but that requirement is not mirrored by requirements on other This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
106  
 channels, such as social media and streaming services, then the public could become 
desensitized when they see an ad on one of those other channels that lacks that 
disclosure because they assume, they make the assumption that the disclosure applies to 
all the channels equally.  And that is why we want to make sure that we get this right.   
This is actually an issue that the Artificial Intelligence Task Force here in the House 
has discussed.  And I can tell you that the implementation of it is more complicated than merely requiring a disclosure, because you have to talk about what AI is and what it isn't, what it has been used for and what it hasn't.  And the example you and I were talking 
about absolutely 100  percent is something that not only should require disclosure, it 
should not be allowed, in my opinion.   
But the use of AI being  -- to choose the opposite end of the extreme --  to clean up 
the audio of a candidate in a speech, which also occurs, is something that is completely 
benign and might not even require disclosure.  So the devil is in the details.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  So I just want to say, I completely agree with you.  
This is complicated.  I would be very happy to have a conversation about that, but it is very clear that transparency is a good thing, we have authority here, and also that you have got to start somewhere.  Our proposal is just a request for public comment.  And when you think about AI and the confusion involved and the complexities of these issues, asking for public comment about an issue of transparency is a good thing.  
Mr. Obernolte.   Right.  I would agree.  And let's work together to make sure 
that this happens.  We want to make sure it happens in a way that solves the problem completely so it applies to all the channels of communication and solves the problem comprehensively in a way that doesn't devolve into different agencies arguing over does the FCC have the authority, does the FEC, has Congress delegated this authority.  You This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
107  
 know what, let's get the problem solved by working together.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   And, listen, I think our public  -- and I think our Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking that I proposed can open up a dialogue for just that.  We can in 
public discuss these issues; try to refine the kind of definitions that you just described, /understand what applies to Federal elections, State elections, local elections issue campaigns; and make sure that we come up with something that is simple and that people can trust; and just puts transparency front and center for the American public.  I think we are all capable of doing that, and I think that is what our proposal was designed 
to do.  
Mr. Obernolte.   Let's work together on that.  
Mr. Carr.   Yeah.  This is not something that we should be rushing through on 
the eve of an election.  As you noted, it is complex.  You have got deceptive deep fakes 
on the one hand, you have got the use of ChatGPT to run scripts for ads on the other end.  This is something that Congress is taking a serious look at.  It is complicated.  We 
shouldn't be rushing this through before an election.  
Mr. Obernolte.   Commissioner Carr, I appreciate your engagement on that.  My 
point about the different channels I stole from your testimony, so thank you very much 
for being engaged on that.  
My time has expired.   
Seeing no further members waiting to be recognized, I would like to thank our 
witnesses for being here today.  I think this has been a very useful exercise in not only the separation of powers but our ability to work together.  And means a lot to me that you are willing to come here and testify.  
I would ask unanimous consent to insert in the record the documents included in This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

II.  HOW TO FILE A FOIA REQUEST:  
1. FOIA requests should be submitted  via ArkCase at: 
https://fcc.arkcase.co m/foia/portal/home  
 
2. You may mail the request to the Office of Managing  Director; Attention:   FOIA 
Public Liaison, Federal Communications  Commission,  45 L Street NE, Suite 3-309,

   Administrative  Appeals must be submitted  to P. Michele Ellison Chief FOIA 
Officer, Office of General Counsel, Suite 10-425, Federal Communications  
Commission,  45 L Street NE, Washington,  DC 20554.  The application  for review 
and the envelope  containing  it should be captioned  “Review of Freedom of 
Information  Action.”  A copy must also be served on the person (if any) who 
originally submitted  the materials  at issue in the FOIA request to the 
Commission.   Appeals can also be filed electronically  at FOIA‐Appeal@fcc.gov .  
3.  Brief description  of why some requests are not granted and an overview of 
certain general categories  of the agency’s records to which the FOIA exemptions  
apply.  
  Requests that are denied or partially denied usually fall under Exemptions  4, 5, 6 
and 7.  The type of information  most often withheld involves materials  that are 
related solely to trade secrets and other confidential  business information  
(exemption  4), inter‐agency or intra‐agency communications  that are protected  
by legal privileges  (exemption  5); information  deemed an unwarranted  invasion 
of personal privacy (Exemption  6); and law enforcement ‐related records 
(Exemption  7). 
III.  ACRONYMS,  DEFINITIONS,  AND EXEMPTIONS   
1.  Agency‐specific acronyms  used in this Report:  
  FCC – Federal Communications  Commission  
  AFR – Application  for Review  
  FOIA – Freedom of Information  Act  
2.  Terms used throughout  this Report:  
a.  Administrative  Appeal – a request to a federal agency asking that it 
review at a higher administrative  level a FOIA determination  made by the 
agency at the initial request level. 
b.  Average Number – the number obtained by dividing the sum of a group 
of numbers by the quantity of numbers in the group.  For example, of 3, 
7, and 14, the average number is 8. 
c.  Backlog – the number of requests or administrative  appeals that are 
pending at an agency at the end of the fiscal year that are beyond the 
statutory time period for a response.    
5 
 d.  Component  – for agencies that process requests on a decentralized  basis, 
a “component”  is an entity, also sometimes  referred to as an Office, 
Division, Bureau, Center, or Directorate,  within the agency that processes  
FOIA requests.   The FOIA now requires that agencies include in their 
Annual FOIA Report data for both the agency overall and for each 
principal component  of the agency.  
e.  Consultation  – the procedure  whereby the agency responding  to a FOIA 
request first forwards a record to another agency for its review because 
that other agency has an interest in the document.   Once the agency in 
receipt of the consultation  finishes its review of the record, it responds 
back to the agency that forwarded  it.  That agency, in turn, will then 
respond to the FOIA requester.      
f.  Exemption  3 Statute – a federal statute that exempts information  from 
disclosure  and which the agency relies on to withhold information  under 
subsection  (b)(3) of the FOIA.   
g.  FOIA Request – a FOIA request is generally a request to a federal agency 
for access to records concerning  another person (i.e., a “third‐party” 
request), or concerning  an organization,  or a particular  topic of interest.  
FOIA requests also include requests made by requesters  seeking records 
concerning  themselves  (i.e., “first‐party” requests)  when those 
requesters  are not subject to the Privacy Act, such as non‐U.S. citizens.  
Moreover,  because all first‐party requesters  should be afforded the 
benefit of both the access provisions  of the FOIA as well as those of the 
Privacy Act, FOIA requests also include any first‐party requests where an 
agency determines  that it must search beyond its Privacy Act “systems of 
records” or where a Privacy Act exemption  applies, and the agency looks 
to FOIA to afford the greatest possible access.  All requests which require 
the agency to utilize the FOIA in responding  to the requester  are included 
in this Report.  Additionally,  a FOIA request includes records referred to 
the agency for processing  and direct response to the requester.   It does 
not, however,  include records for which the agency has received a 
consultation  from another agency.  (Consultations  are reported 
separately  in Section XII of this Report.) 
h.  Full Grant – an agency decision to disclose all records in full in response 
to a FOIA request. 
i.  Full Denial – an agency decision not to release any records in response to 
a FOIA request because the records are exempt in their entireties  under 
one or more of the FOIA exemptions,  or because of a procedural  reason, 
such as when no records could be located.  
6 
 j.  Median Number – the middle, not average, number.  For example, of 3, 
7, and 14, the median number is 7.  
k.  Multi‐Track Processing  – a system in which simple requests requiring 
relatively  minimal review are placed in one processing  track and more 
voluminous  and complex requests are placed in one or more other tracks.  
Requests granted expedited  processing  are placed in yet another track.  
Requests in each track are processed  on a first in/first out basis.   
i.  Expedited  Processing  – an agency will process a FOIA 
request on an expedited  basis when a requester  satisfies 
the requirements  for expedited  processing  as set forth in 
the statute and in agency regulations.   
ii.   Simple Request – a FOIA request that an agency using 
multi‐track processing  places in its fastest (non‐expedited)  
track based on the low volume and/or simplicity  of the 
records requested.   
iii.  Complex Request – a FOIA request that an agency using 
multi‐track processing  places in a slower track based on 
the high volume and/or complexity  of the records 
requested.   
l.  Partial Grant/Partial  Denial – in response to a FOIA request, an agency 
decision to disclose portions of the records and to withhold other 
portions that are exempt under the FOIA, or to otherwise  deny a portion 
of the request for a procedural  reason.  
m.  Pending Request or Pending Administrative  Appeal – a request or 
administrative  appeal for which an agency has not taken final action in all 
respects.  
n.  Perfected  Request – a request for records which reasonably  describes  
such records and is made in accordance  with published  rules stating the 
time, place, fees (if any) and procedures  to be followed.  
o.  Processed  Request or Processed  Administrative  Appeal – a request or 
administrative  appeal for which an agency has taken final action in all 
respects. 
p.  Range in Number of Days – the lowest and highest number of days to 
process requests or administrative  appeals.   
7 
 q.  Time Limits – the time period in the statute for an agency to respond to a 
FOIA request (ordinarily  twenty working days from receipt of a perfected  
FOIA request). 
3.  Descriptions  of the nine FOIA exemptions:  
a.  Exemption  1:  classified national defense and foreign relations

would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication,  (C) could reasonably  be expected to constitute  an 
unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy, (D) could reasonably  be

Emergency Alerting —False Alarm  in Hawaii
Background  
On Saturday, January 13, 2018, at 8:07 a.m., an emergency 
alert was issued by  Hawaii’s Emergency Management 
Agency ( HI-EMA) warning residents  and visitors in Hawaii 
of an i ncoming ballistic missile.  The message was sen t by 
HI-EMA through the state’s emergency alert system which 
distributed it to radio and television stations and to 
thousands of cell phone users in Hawaii. Widespread fear 
and panic was reported.   
 
Within minutes, HI -EMA officials received the alert on 
their own cell phones and realized the message was sent in 
error. HI-EMA reported that a team member issued an 
actual alert instead of a test alert d uring a required test of 
the system  at a shift change.  HI -EMA then had difficulty 
issuing a correction/retraction message.   
When they received the alert, t he Hawaii National Guard 
reportedly contacted U.S. Pacific Command  (USPACOM) 
which confirmed there had been no missile launch. 
Representative  Tulsi Gabbard contacted the Hawaii 
National Guard, confirmed there was no threat, and released 
a “FALSE ALARM” me ssage on Twitter at 8:19 a.m .  
 
HI-EMA posted a “FALSE ALARM” message on 
Facebook and Twitter at 8: 20 a.m., but the official 
correction from HI -EMA through the state’s emergency 
alerting system was not  released until 8:45 a.m. —38 
minutes after the initial alert.  
Residents and elected officials criticized the length of time 
HI-EMA took to issue the corre ction.  Timeline  
HI-EMA shared a timeline of events at a press confe rence 
held on January 13, 2018:   
8:07 a.m.—The initial alert was sent . 
8:10—HI-EMA o fficials received the alert on their own cell 
phones  and started the cancellation process . 
8:13—Hawaii’s State Warning Point  (the state’s central 
communication center)  initiated the process  to stop 
transmitting the message . 
8:20—HI-EMA posted the cancellation message 
to Facebook and Twitter.  
8:24—Governor Ige retweet ed the cancellation message .  
8:30—Governor  Ige posted the cancellation on Facebook . 
8:45—HI-EMA issued a second alert over the emergency 
alert system, announcing the false alarm.   
The Nation’s Alerting System  
In 2006, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 
(E.O.) 13407 establishing a pol icy for national alerts and 
warnings.  The E.O.  provide s the President with a means to 
communicate with citizens during emergencies, and 
recognizes the role of state, local, tribal , and territorial 
entities in  emergency response.   
The E.O. requires the Dep artment of Homeland Security 
(DHS) to lead the effort, in coordination with federal, state, 
local, tribal, territorial , and private sector partners  – to 
integrate and modernize the n ation’s p ublic alert and 
warning systems.  These systems include:  
 Emergency  Alert System (EAS) ; 
 National Warning System (NAWAS) ; 
 Wireless Emergency Alert s (WEA) ; and  
 NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards . 
The network is designed to integrate the nation’s warning 
systems into one system , called the Integrated Public Al ert 
and Warning System (IPAWS).  IPAWS is managed and 
funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA), a component of DHS.  IPAWS  allows alerts to be 
originated by federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial 
officials , and then sent through the IPAWS system w hich 
disseminates the message to the  public using multiple 
alerting systems  (e.g., EAS sends the alert to television and 
radio, WEA sends the alert to cell phones).  
Emergency Alerting —False Alarm in Hawaii  
https://crsreports.congress.gov  The benefit of IPAWS is that it allows authorized state and 
local officials to send one messag e to many channels at the 
same time, reducing the time needed to send messages, 
reducing the possibility  of errors in message content and 
delivery, and ensuring timely delivery to citizens who may 
rely on different devices to receive emergency alerts.   
As shown in this  incident, officials may leverage multiple 
means of communication (e.g., social media) to send 
messages to citizens . This is not part of the national alerting 
system. The resulting  benefits are that these  messages are 
fast and easy to send; t he risks are that they may not be 
accurate or coordinated with emergency management staff.  
FCC Role  
The Federal Communications Commission (F CC) plays an 
impo rtant role in emergency alerts.  In conjunction with 
FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration’s (NOAA) National Weather Service 
(NWS) , the FCC  implements the national Emergency Alert 
System (EAS) . The EAS is a national public warning 
system that requires broadcasters (e. g., television, cable, 
satellite)  to provide c ommunications capabilities to (1 ) the 
President to address the American public duri ng a national 
emergency, and (2 ) state and local governments to provide 
important emergency information to specific areas.  
The FCC’s role includes prescribing rules that establish 
technical standards for the EAS, procedures for 
broadcasters to follow, and testing protocols.  
Further, the FCC is responsible for implementing the 
provisions in the Warning, Alert , and Response Networ k 
(WARN) Act (P.L. 109 -347), which allowed commercial 
mobile service (CMS) providers to transmit the alerts to cell 
phones, if they chose.  In 2016, the FCC adopted rules t o 
improve Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) , including 
making  alert messages longer ( more  characters), supporting 
URL links to provide additional information to citizens, and 
supporting Spanish -language alerts.    
Alerting Authorities  
A federal, state, terri torial, tribal, or local agency that has 
been granted authority by its government to alert the public 
in emergency sit uations can sign up for IPAWS. That 
agency is known as an “Alerting Authority.”   
IPAWS is accessed through special software that must mee t 
IPAWS system requirements. Alerting A uthorities can 
select software from a list of private sector developers who 
have successfully tested that software in an IPAWS Open 
Platform for Emergency Network (IPAWS -OPEN) test 
environment or they can select their  own software that must 
then be tested in the IPAWS -OPEN test environment.   
While access to IPAWS is free, and there is no cost to 
sending messages, Alerting Authorities must purchase the 
IPAWS -compatible software to access the system.  Incident in Hawaii —After Alert Was 
Sent  
Immediately a fter the alert was sent, H I-EMA officials 
spent time researc hing how to retract the message . HI-EMA 
officials asked FEMA for clarification about whether they 
could use IPAWS to rescind an alert .  FEMA stated that HI-
EMA  did not need approval to retract the alert, that it had 
authority to cancel or retract any time.  
In a press conference several hours later, HI-EMA 
confirmed that the release of the “FALSE ALARM”  was 
delayed while they consulted FEMA on the retraction 
policy and crafted the cancellation message.   HI-EMA also 
confirmed that their alerting software allows for single -
activation and verification of alerts.  HI -EMA has since 
changed that protocol to require dual verification.  
Some congressional policymakers  have called for hearings 
on the incident, citing a need to review  federal -state-local 
communications and response protocols during national 
security incidents, and  request ing preparedness assistance. 
The state legislature is also conducting hearings .  
Issues  for Congress  
Congressional hearings on the incident are planned . Issues 
for consideration may include:   
 How a re states prepared for disasters?  Congress may 
hold hearings on the i ncident to learn about the issues 
Hawaii  faced  (e.g., communications, trans portation, 
public health and safety) ; what FEMA has done and is 
doing to help states prepare for disaster ; how well states 
feel they are  prepared for disasters; and what FEMA can 
do to strengthen preparedness in all states.  
 Are improvements t o the national alert  system needed?  
Congress may wish  to request that FEMA/IPAWS 
review the software endorsed for use with IPAWS to 
ensure any features that could contribute to false alerts 
are corrected; review training modules to ensure 
cancellation procedure s are included; provide additional 
training to states on cancellation protocols; and share 
lessons learned from Hawaii with other IPAWS users.  
 How may policymakers  improve alert  systems ?  The 
system successfully delivered the alert, but provided 
limited i nformation about what to do in response.  There 
may be a need for the FCC, FEMA/IPAWS, and state 
emergency managers to coordinate to improve alerts and 
the delivery of f ollow -on in structions. T he FCC is 
investigating the incident in Hawaii. Congress may wish 
to ask the FCC to share its findings, to determine how 
Congress may assist in improving alerts.  
 How may policymakers improve coordination during 
response?  Congress may review the findings from any 
after-action reports or investigations of this incident  to 
address any issues with communications, coordination , 
and response among feder al, state, and local officials .

The Honorable William J. Clinton
 President of the United States
The White House
Washington, D. C. 20500
Dear Mr. President:
Attached for your review is the Federal Communications Commission’s Annual
Performance Report for Fiscal Year 1999.
We are pleased with the results of our efforts.  We met or partially met sixty of
our sixty-nine goals—an 87 percent success rate.   In addition to our program goals, we
embarked on an ambitious course of action to completely revise our Strategic Plan to
ensure that our plan reflects the goals of a converging and increasingly global
telecommunications industry.  In redoing our plan, we reached out to industry, to state,
regional, and local governments, to academe and consumer interest groups, and to our
own employees to provide us with input into the plan.  In August 1999, we issued a draft
Strategic Plan that, I believe, provides measurable, results-oriented performance goals for
the next five years.
Another notable achievement in Fiscal Year 1999 was the completion of our plan
to consolidate our enforcement and consumer information activities.  Historically, the
FCC has been organized along the traditional lines of wire, wireless, satellite, broadcast
and cable communications.  This traditional structure no longer makes sense in an era
when the lines dividing many communications service providers are blurring.
Consolidation of our consumer information services will allow us to provide improved
information services to consumers facing a bewildering choice of competing
telecommunications services.  Centralization of our enforcement activities will allow us
to respond quickly and efficiently to questionable activities in an increasingly deregulated
marketplace.  Moreover, our consumer information and enforcement staff will share
information that will enable us to spot trends and areas of consumer and industry
concern.
I would also like to note that we achieved this level of success despite some
formidable programmatic obstacles, including:
• A multi-phased, logistically complex agency move that required that we maintain
duplicate operations for seven months.  This move, and the need to maintain two
separate sites, challenged our resources, particularly our information technology
infrastructure;• An in-depth review of all our mission critical automated processing systems to ensure
that each system was fully Year-2000 compliant.  This effort required a months-long
review and testing of our major systems and the identification of all smaller systems
that required conversion before December 31, 1999.
• In addition, we completed a Business Continuity and Contingency Plan for every
automated system, major or minor, in case our reviews failed to identify all Y2k
problems.  The need to complete these reviews and contingency plans resulted in our
deferring scheduled enhancements or replacements to several major licensing and
document management systems;
• Failure to obtain the necessary funding in Fiscal Year 1999 to upgrade our network
infrastructure and to complete several of the performance goals specified in our Fiscal
Year 1999 Annual Performance Plan. For example, we deferred completion of the
implementation of two of the Mass Media Bureau’s electronic filing systems and an
agency-wide electronic document management system.  We plan to complete work on
these systems in Fiscal Year 2000, if additional funding can be obtained.
I look forward to hearing your comments on our Annual Performance Plan.
Sincerely,
William E. Kennard
Chairman

(If goal not met, provide explanation, planned remedy, and target date
for meeting goal) Method of Measurement
(Performance Indicators)
We will review our authorization of
service rules and will simplify and
streamline those authorization
requests where appropriate.Yes The FCC made significant progress in simplifying and streamlining authorization of service
rules in Fiscal Year 1999.  In common carrier matters, we eliminated entry certification
requirements under Section 214 of the Communications Act and approved a streamlined
authorization process for international applications that will qualify approximately 99 percent
of applications for 14-day processing.  In May, we adopted an order substantially revising and,
in some cases, eliminating the International Settlements Policy.  We also streamlined electronic
filing of 15 key broadcast application and reporting forms, representing 88 percent of all
broadcast authorization forms.  A competitive bidding process was approved to replace the
comparative hearing process for the selection of mutually exclusive broadcast applicants.  We
adopted new, simplified rules for the equipment authorization process, deregulating the
equipment authorization requirements for certain types of equipment, and providing for
electronic filing.  Finally, we are nearing completion on the development and implementation
of a Universal Licensing System that provides streamlined electronic Internet filing capabilities
for most wireless services, provides application and tracking status information and reduces the
number of wireless application forms from 63 to five.Performance was measured through a
review and analysis of authorization of
service data and other workload reports
provided by the Bureaus and Offices.
We will meet 90% of our customer
Speed of Disposal processing
goals.Partially
MetThe majority of license applications in all services were processed within established
timeframes.  Those services where the goal was not met were impacted by a variety of
situations including efforts to develop and implement new electronic, Internet accessible, filing
systems, Y2K compliancy issues, the convergence of technologies and industries that created
significant complications in the traditional licensing processes, and agency-wide efforts to
reduce backlogged applications.  We anticipate that we will make significant progress in
meeting our processing goals in Fiscal Year 2000.Performance was measured through
analysis of data contained in internal
workload reports.2We will provide electronic filing
capabilities for CCB, MMB, IB,
WTB, and OET licensing systems.
 We will improve our Speed of
Disposal and public access to the
status of license applications by
integrating Wireless
Telecommunications Bureau’s ten
licensing systems into a single,
integrated database.-We will
improve our Speed of Disposal and
public access to the status of
license applications by re-
engineering and integrating 13
Mass Media Bureau licensing and
authorization of service databases.
  -We will improve our Speed of
Disposal and improve public access
to information through
implementation of redesigned, fully
automated Equipment
Authorization and Experimental
Radio Service licensing systems.Mostly
MetIn Fiscal Year 1999 we continued to implement electronic filing capabilities including systems
in the Common Carrier, International, Wireless Telecommunications Bureaus, and the Office
of Engineering and Technology. Our Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has deployed 7 out
of the ten commercial wireless services as part of its Universal Service Licensing System. Our
Mass Media Bureau has developed electronic licensing capabilities for all of its services and
licensing systems.  However, access to the public was delayed due to Y2k preparation priorities
and budgetary constraints.  Full implementation of these systems is dependent on adequate
funding in Fiscal Year 2000.Performance is measured by the number of
authorization systems reengineered, the
number of electronic filing systems
implemented, and the effect of both on our
licensees.
We will provide immediate access
to routine common carrier Local
Access Transport Area
modifications by placing these
electronically on public notice upon
receipt.Yes All routine common carrier Local Access Transport Area modifications are now immediately
placed on public notice and are accessible electronically through the Commission’s Digital
Index. The comment and reply period for such requests is typically limited to 3 weeks.  An
order addressing the requested modification matters is issued approximately 60 days from the
date of original filing.Performance was measured by changes in
the common carrier Local Access Transport
Area modification processing to provide
immediate access.
We will allow telecommunications
carriers wishing to add new or to
discontinue old lines to obtain
authority under Section 214 with
no regulatory delays.Yes On June 30, 1999, we released a Report and Order revising Part 63 rules eliminating the
requirement to file applications for entry authority.  This order also stipulated that applications
for discontinuance would be granted automatically. Since these rules were implemented, no
entry applications have been filed, and all but two applications for discontinuance have been
allowed to become effective automatically.Performance was measured by the adoption
of rule changes to reduce or eliminate
regulatory delays.3Functional Area : Authorization of Service
Objective:  #2 We will utilize spectrum auctions whenever feasible for efficient licensing and innovative use of
the electromagnetic spectrum allowing the most advantageous use of the scarce spectrum and expedited new
customer services.

We will meet all Congressionally-
mandated auction schedules in FY
1999.Yes There were no Congressionally-mandated auctions during Fiscal Year 1999.  The FCC did
conduct six auctions that awarded approximately 1,700 licenses for $640 million.There were no Congressionally--mandated
auctions.4Functional Area : Authorization of Service

(Performance Indicators)
We will meet 90% of our customer
Speed of Disposal goals.Mostly
MetThe majority of license applications in all services were processed within established time
frames. In several services customer goals were not met due to a variety of reasons—including
efforts to develop and implement new electronic filing systems, Y2K compliancy issues, and
an agency-wide effort to eliminate backlogged applications.  We expect to make significant
progress in meeting our customer service goals in Fiscal Year 2000, given the funding required
to continue our implementation of electronic filing  systems.Performance was measured through
analysis of data contained in internal
workload reports.5Functional Area : Policy and Rulemaking
Objective : #1 We will restructure and streamline the FCC, eliminating outdated or redundant organizations
and overlapping regulations.

(Performance Indicators)
We will continue to use our
forbearance authority where
appropriate.Yes The Commission issued 24 orders addressing petitions for forbearance in FY 1999. Performance was measured by review of
Orders issued in connection with parties’
requests for forebearance from regulation.
We will review the FCC’s functions
and structures and eliminate obsolete
or overlapping ones .Yes In Fiscal Year 1999, the FCC completed all planning for the consolidation of its enforcement
and consumer information activities.  The consolidation of these two key functions will
improve efficiency and enhance the delivery on consumer information and enforcement
services to the general public and to industry.  In Fiscal Year 1998, the FCC conducted an
agency-wide biennial review to eliminate, consolidate, and/or revise rules that were obsolete or
outdated.  During Fiscal Year 1999, the FCC completed rulemakings streamlining accounting,
reporting, and depreciation rules and released an order finding that it should privatize its
accounting authority in maritime radio services. We  also commenced Phase I of a
Comprehensive Accounting Review to further review areas of possible streamlining.  For other
actions, see next entry.Performance was measured by a
determination that the 1998 Biennial
Regulatory Review was completed and by a
review of other actions taken during FY
1999 that further reduced obsolete or
overlapping functions.
We will continue to evaluate whether
certain regulations are no longer
necessary in the public interest and
should be repealed or modified as
required by Section 11 of the
Communications Act and Section
202(h) of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996.Yes As mentioned in the goal above, we conducted a comprehensive review of all agency rules in
Fiscal Year 1998 to eliminate, consolidate, and/or revise those rules that are no longer in the
public interest.  During FY 1999, the FCC released 9 orders and 1 policy statement regarding
subjects potentially no longer necessary to the public interest.  Specific steps taken included:
   In March 1999,  we adopted an order streamlining the Section 214 authorization process;
 In May 1999, we adopted an order substantially revising and, in some cases, eliminating
          the International Settlements Policy.
 In June 1999, we adopted an order revising the settlement rate benchmark for facilities-
          based service on affiliated foreign routes.
  We also made fundamental changes to broadcast application and licensing procedures.
          These changes simplify, streamline, and  make more customer- friendly our rules,
          applications, and application procedures.
 In August 1999, we concluded our review of various ownership  rules, and modified  the
          Local TV “duopoly” restrictions and its local radio/TV cross-ownership restriction, as
          well as its national television ownership rule.  The FCC is currently considering
         additional changes to its ownership rules to conform to the current  marketplace as an
         additional implementation of the 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review.Performance was measured by a
determination that the 1998 Biennial
Regulatory Review was completed and by a
review of other actions taken during FY
1999 that further reduced rules that were
determined to no longer serve the public
interest.6We will complete relocation of the
FCC into a consolidated facility.Yes Relocation into a consolidated facility was successfully completed in May 1999. Performance was measured by the
completion of the relocation.
We will coordinate network
disclosure reporting requirements
under Section 251 and 273 of the
Communications Act to avoid any
duplicate or redundant disclosure
regulationsYes Section 251 network disclosures are placed on public notice typically within one week of
receipt.  The public notice indicates only that parties seeking information should visit the web
site. There have been no recorded complaints of this procedure or its overlapping with Section
273.Performance was measured by number of
complaints concerning overlap or
redundancy of network disclosure reporting
requirements under Section 251 and 273.
We will review the CCB Computer III
Court Remand to determine whether
any of the network disclosure rules
under Section 251(c)(5) duplicate or
even exceed the rules established
under the Computer II and Computer
III decisionsYes We eliminated the Computer III network disclosure rules in the Computer III Remand Order
issued in July 1999.Performance was measured by completion
of the Computer III Court Remand and any
changes made to network disclosure rules.
We will privatize the International
Telecommunications Settlements
(ITS) process.Yes We adopted an order ending our role as the maritime accounting authority in July 1999. Performance was measured by completion
of actions needed to privatize the
International Telecommunications
Settlements process.
We will determine whether
privatization of the electronic filing
functions lowers costs to the public
and improves their access to tariff
filings.No The FCC implemented an electronic tariff filing system (EFTS) that permits incumbent local
exchange carriers to submit federal tariffs and associated documents via the Internet.  Other
parties participating in tariff proceedings may also file tariff-related documents using ETFS.
ETFS also enables interested parties to access and download these documents over the Internet.
Due to limited resources devoted to Y2K related issues, the Bureau did not complete a
comprehensive review to determine whether the privatization of the electronic filing function
would be beneficial to our customers.Performance was measured by completion
of a determination of whether privatization
of the electronic filing functions lowers
costs to the public and improves their
access to tariff filings.
We will continue to hold public for a
and meet with our state regulatory
partners and consumer groups to
solicit input and feedback to ensure
our rules are in the public interest and
are the least burdensome to achieve
stated goalsYes During FY 1999, we conducted a number of important meetings and fora.  Chief among these
was the three public meetings held in May and June to discuss the FCC’s Draft Strategic Plan.
Members of the telecommunications industry (May 20), state and local government (June 2),
and academic and organizational experts (June 11) participated in- person and via the Internet.
The transcripts of each of these meetings were published at our website.  We continued to meet
with state regulatory partners and consumer groups and held a number of public fora.  Monthly
meetings were held with the North American Numbering Council and FCC representatives
attended every meeting of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commission.  FCC
staff attended a number of meetings in preparation for the upcoming World
Radiocommunications Conference. Staff attended bimonthly meetings with the Local and State
Government Advisory Committee. Finally, public fora were held to discuss a variety of issues
including implementation of Telecommunications Relay Services, proposals for streamlining
Part 68 terminal equipment registration, industry views on cable landing license policy and
procedures, and seminars on political programming rules.Performance was measured by a review of
the meetings and fora held during the fiscal
year.7Functional Area : Policy and Rulemaking
Objective: #2 We will encourage competition in the telecommunications industry through pro-competitive,
deregulatory rulemakings, reducing consumer costs and increasing the telecommunications choices available to
consumers.
1999 Performance GoalsGoal
Met?
(Y/N)1999 Actual Performance
(If goal not met, provide explanation, planned remedy, and target date
for meeting goal) Method of Measurement
(Performance Indicators)
We will continue to implement the
local competition provisions of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.Yes The FCC released the following Reports and Orders implementing the local competition
provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996:
• Unbundling Remand Report and Order, the Collocation Order;
• the Line Sharing Order;
• the Review of Accounting and Cost Allocation Requirements and the Review of ARMIS
Reporting Requirements;
• the Pricing Flexibility Order (that also included an NPRM on whether CLEC access rates
         should be regulated).
Additionally, significant progress was made on two Access Reform Proceedings (X-factor
Remand and CALLS Petition).  Field work or audits and surveys concerning collocation,
number hoarding, and local number portability costs were completed as was a generic audit
program for Section 272 Biennial audits.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to promote competition.
We will work to improve the
connections of classrooms, libraries
and rural health care facilities to the
Internet by the end of FY 1999 and to
maintain affordable
telecommunications services to rural
America.Yes In Fiscal Year 1999, the FCC released an order extending first year funding for Schools and
Libraries (S&L) and for the Rural Heath Care (RHC) programs to allow more applicants to
participate.  We issued an order establishing  the second year funding level of the  S&L
program at $2.25 billion, and of the RHC program at $12 million,   We also issued orders
simplifying the process for rural health care providers to receive universal service support and
allowing non-ETCs  to obtain credit against their contributions for services provided to rural
health care providersPerformance was measured a review of
actions taken to promote connections of
classrooms, libraries, and rural health
facilities to the Internet.
We will make telecommunications
services and equipment accessible to
persons with disabilities by
completing a rulemaking to
implement Section 255 of the Act.Yes The FCC adopted and released an order implementing Section 255 of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996.  Additionally, we convened a public forum on access to 711, designated as the
nationwide number for Telecommunications Relay Services.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to promote the accessibility of
telecommunications services and equipment
to persons with disabilities.
We will make emergency information
carried on cable systems available to
persons with hearing disabilities.No A draft order adopting emergency information requirements has been prepared and final FCC
action is expected by March 31, 2000.Performance was measured by a review of
action taken to make emergency
information carried on cable systems
available to persons with hearing
disabilities.8We will ensure that public safety
groups have adequate spectrum and
advanced telecommunications
equipment by completing “The
Development of Operational,
Technical and Spectrum
Requirements for Meeting Federal,
State and Local Public Safety Agency
Communications Requirements
Through the Year 2010.”Yes In April 1999, the FCC adopted a Memorandum Opinion and Order addressing concerns raised
by American National Standard Institute and allowing the work of the Public Safety National
Coordination Committee (NCC) to proceed in a timely fashion, with the flexibility to operate
with increased efficiency.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to ensure adequate spectrum
and advanced telecommunications
equipment for public safety use.
We will continue implementation of
the World Trade Organization Basic
Services Agreement, which will allow
WTO-member nations to apply for
authorization to provide competitive
telecommunications services to U.S.
customers.Yes • In March 1999, the FCC adopted an order further streamlining the Section 214-
authorization process and rules regarding foreign notifications.  The FCC continues to
grant most applications to provide international telecommunications services, including
those from foreign-owned carriers, pursuant to a 14-day streamlined process.
• We also participated in regulator-to-regulator meetings covering topics such as
interconnection principles and independent and transparent regulatory regimes.
•  In August 1999, we authorized certain U.S. earth stations to provide fixed-satellite
services (FSS) to, from, and within the U.S. via New Skies Satellites, NV.Performance was measured by a review of
the actions taken to promote
implementation of the WTO Basic Services
Agreement.
We will implement an efficient, pro-
competitive procedure for the
administration of, and access to, N11
codes and other abbreviated dialing
arrangements.Yes The FCC is considering proposals from the United Way and the Department of Transportation
for establishment of a N11 code.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to implement an efficient, pro-
competitive procedure for administration of
and access to N11 codes.
We will apply, and continue to refine
pricing rules that allow incumbent
Local Exchange Carriers additional
flexibility in pricing interstate access
consistent with the development of
competition.Yes During 1999, we released the following orders refining the pricing rules for incumbent Local
Exchange Carriers:
• Order and FNPRM for Pricing Flexibility, Access Charge Reform;
•  Price Cap Performance Review for Local Exchange Carriers Order;
•  Inter-exchange Carrier Purchases of Switched Access Services offered by competitive
Local Exchange Carriers;
•  Petition of U S West Communications, Inc. for Forbearance from Regulation as a
Dominant Carrier in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA in August 1999.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to refine pricing rules to allow
additional flexibility to ILECs in pricing
interstate access.
We will continue to examine and
develop economic cost models to
ensure that these estimate the accurate
costs of providing unbundled network
elements and access services.Yes The FCC released an Order adopting final input values for the Commission’s cost model,
which is used to estimate the prospective costs of providing support services.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to develop economic cost
models that accurately estimate costs for
providing unbundled network element and
access services.
We will initiate rulemakings to update
Part 68 of our rules and regulations to
incorporate technological innovations.No The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the deregulation of Part 68-equipment registration is
tentatively scheduled for consideration in March 2000.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to update Part 68 of the rules
and regulations.
We will implement procedures to
administer carrier identification codes
(CIC) in an efficient and
nondiscriminatory manner.Yes The three-to-four digit CIC conversion deadline was September 1, 1998.  During that time,
several waiver petitions were granted to accommodate the network plans of small carriers. The
last waiver expired on December 30, 1999 (Virgin Islands Telephone Company).Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to implement procedures to
administer carrier identification codes.9We will refine existing rules
concerning caller ID to respond to
consumer concerns about services that
use calling party numbers.Yes The FCC received very few calls concerning caller ID and currently has only two Petitions for
Reconsideration and one Petition for Review.  Consumer concerns are now handled as informal
complaints and additional refining of the existing rules appears to be unnecessary at this time.Performance was measured by a review of
consumer concerns received on this issue
and a determination of  the need for rule
changes.
We will establish procedures for
certification of rural carriers for
purposes of universal service high
cost support.No The FCC concluded in the Universal Service First Report and Order that reform of high-cost
support for rural carriers should not occur until January 1, 2001, at the earliest, and only after
recommendations have been received from the Joint Board, and a Rural Task Force appointed
by the Joint Board.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to establish procedures for
certification of rural carriers for universal
service high cost support.
We will initiate a rulemaking to
eliminate the requirement for
equipment manufacturers to obtain
waivers for equipment that
automatically takes the subscriber
lines “off-hook.”Yes Currently, waiver requests to take lines ‘off hook’ are judged by the standard set forth in an
order addressing the Part 68 Waiver Request of Alameda Engineering, Inc. (commonly referred
to as the Alameda Order).  The equipment waiver request process will be addressed  as
part of the Part 68 streamlining Notice of Proposed Rulemaking scheduled for consideration in
the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2000,Performance was measured by review of
actions taken to eliminate the requirement
for equipment manufacturers to obtain
waivers for this type of equipment.
We will streamline the
Telecommunications Relay Service
Fund administration procedures to
align it with other Commission
interstate cost-recovery programs.Yes The FCC changed the cost-recovery mechanism for the TRS Fund from a gross-revenues
formula to an end-user formula in our Streamlined Contributor Reporting Requirements Report
and Order, in accordance with the practices specified for several other funds mandated by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to streamline the TRS Fund
administration procedures.
We will continue to promote the
efficient use and allocation of toll free
numbers and deploy additional toll
free service.No The FCC anticipates releasing a Report and Order regarding the neutral administration of toll-
free numbers in April 2000.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to promote the efficient use
and allocation of toll-free numbers and
deploy additional toll-free service.
We will continue to participate in
global standard setting for
communications servicesYes In February 1999, the FCC proposed rules to implement the international arrangements
governing Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite (GMPCS) adopted by ITU.
The NPRM outlines a comprehensive procedure for licensing, marking, certification, and
customs treatment of GMPCS terminals.  It also proposes safeguards against potential
interference to existing aeronautical radiation services. In 1999, the FCC participated in the
Telecommunication Standardization, Radio Communications, and the Telecommunication
Development Sectors of the ITU and in a number of meetings in preparation for WRC 2000.Performance was measured by the
compilation of the number of actions taken
to promote global standard setting for
communications services.
We will continue to review the
regulatory status of dominant
common carriers to determine
whether reclassification or
forbearance is appropriate.Yes The FCC released five orders addressing several forbearance issues raised by mid-sized ILECs.
Additionally, the FCC began a review of a request by Bell Canada to be reclassified as a
nondominant carrier for the U.S.-Canada route.Performance was measured by a review of
actions taken to review the regulatory status
of dominant common carriers.
We will continue to review whether
merger and transfer of control
requests are in the public interest.Yes The FCC reviewed and approved a number of mergers and transfer of control requests to
determine if they would benefit the public interest, including MCI Telecommunication
Corporation / Echostar; Lockheed Martin/Comsat; Frontier/Global Crossing; Airtouch
Communications/Vodafone; AT&T / British Telecommunications; USSB/DIRECTV,  and
Tempo Satellite, Inc./DIRECTV Enterprises, Inc.Performance was measured in terms of
timely completion of the review of the
requests.10Functional Area : Policy and Rulemaking
Objective:  #3 We will reduce reporting requirements and eliminate unnecessary rules and burdensome
regulations.
1999 Performance GoalsGoal

(Performance Indicators)
We will conduct a review of our rules
and regulations in FY 1998 to
determine which can be eliminated or
revised.  In FY 1999, we will initiate
rulemakings to eliminate obsolete or
overlapping regulatory and/or
reporting requirements.Yes The FCC conducted an agency-wide biennial review in 1998.  Based on this review, we took
the following actions in 1999:
• In common carrier issues, we released 9 orders and 1 policy statement addressing  matters
that were identified as no longer necessary:
• We made fundamental changes to the broadcast application and licensing procedures.
These changes simplify, streamline, and make our rules, application procedures, and
reporting forms more user friendly.  We also updated and streamlined our broadcast rules
and modified the local TV “duopoly” restrictions and our local radio/TV cross-ownership
rules.
• The FCC made significant progress in streamlining our procedures for satellite and other
international application processing issues.   We issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
recommending streamlining and consolidating service rules governing the Direct Satellite
Broadcast (DBS) service to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative regulation, increase
competition to the cable television industry, and facilitate the delivery of new and
innovative services to consumers. We adopted an order streamlining the Section 214
authorization process that will allow 99 percent of all applications to be processed in
fourteen days.  We adopted an order substantially revising and, in some cases, eliminating
the International Settlements Policy. We announced that we will automatically grant
routine satellite earth station applications proposing use of the Ku-band and
communicating with all satellites authorized to provide service to the U.S. within 35 days
from the date of the public notice (provided no objections have been filed). Finally, we
released an order substantially revising the settlement rate benchmark condition for
facilities-based service on affiliated foreign routes.
• The FCC completed its comprehensive streamlining of wireless licensing rules in the
Universal Licensing System rulemaking, Issuing a Memorandum Opinion and Order in
June 1999.  We also initiated a rulemaking focusing on streamlining of its Part 90 rules for
private land mobile radio services, and completed a rulemaking that simplified and
streamlined the Part 97 Amateur Radio Service rules.Performance was measured by confirmation
of the completion of an agency-wide
biennial review during FY 1998 and by a
review of actions taken during FY 1999 to
eliminate obsolete or overlapping regulatory
and/or reporting requirements.11Functional Area : Enforcement
Objective:  #1 We will streamline our complaints process and procedures to ensure timely and satisfactory
resolution of consumer complaints.

(Performance Indicators)
We will increase the number of
pending routine informal common
carrier complaints disposed of by
10%.No We encountered formidable technical problems with our automated informal complaints
system. The most important issue was the system was not Y2K compliant.  To upgrade it to
make it compliant required substantial resources,  raising issues on whether the current system
should be revised or completely replaced.  A thorough review of alternative approaches was
not completed until late in the fiscal year.  Currently, we are making every effort to upgrade the
system as quickly as possible.  In the meantime, we have hired additional temporary clerks to
assist us in processing current complaints as expeditiously as possible.Performance was measured through an
analysis of the Quarterly Workload
Reports that document the Speed of
Disposal of informal consumer
complaints.
We will increase the number of
informal complaints served on
telephone companies by 10%.No See above. See above.
We will improve the Speed of
Disposal for routine informal
common carrier complaints by 20%.No See above See above.
We will reduce the number of active
formal common carrier complaints
pending longer than 15 months
by15%.Yes The FCC exceeded this goal by reducing the number of active pending formal common carrier
complaints by 21% over Fiscal Year 1998 levels.Performance was measured by a review
and analysis of the Quarterly Workload
Reports.
We will reduce the response time on
Telephone Relay Service or Hearing
Aid Compatibility complaints by
50%.Yes Only one such complaint was received and its resolution, and the resolution of any future
complaints received, was folded into the TRS rulemaking scheduled for the February 2000
Commission meeting.  Additional attention is now given to this issue as a result of the
organizational restructuring recently completed by the FCC.Performance was measured by a review of
the actions taken to resolve these kinds of
complaints more quickly.
We will review broadcast and cable
enforcement processes and eliminate
inefficient procedures and practices.Yes During FY 1999, the Commission released an NPRM proposing and requesting comments on
new broadcast and cable EEO rules and policies in light of the Lutheran Church  appellate case,
which declared certain sections of the Commission’s EEO rules unconstitutional.  In
promulgating the NPRM, the Commission sought to streamline EEO requirements as much as
possible while maintaining an effective EEO program for the broadcast and cable industries.Performance was measured by actions
taken to eliminate inefficient procedures
and practices.12Functional Area : Enforcement
Objective:  #2 We will work as a partner with the private sector and with federal, state and local governments
in the investigation and resolution of shared telecommunications problems focusing particularly on issues
affecting the safety of life and property.  This will ensure that problem resolution is achieved quickly, at the least
possible cost and with state and local interests duly considered.

website to include the latest information of interest to the public.Performance was measured by a review of
the number of public appearances by FCC
staff and comments to the FCC website.20Program Evaluations .  In Fiscal Year 1999 the FCC completed a number of agency-wide reviews. These included
• Consolidation of our Enforcement and Consumer Information Activities . The FCC is currently structured along the traditional technology lines of wire, wireless,
satellite, broadcast, and cable communications. This organizational model no longer reflects the industries we oversee.  We have determined that the FCC must reorganize
along functional rather than technology lines to allow us to perform our core responsibilities more effectively.  One of our major performance goals for our Fiscal Year
Annual Performance Plan was to complete work on consolidating our consumer information and enforcement functions. Our enforcement activities were distributed among
all our major bureaus while our consumer information services activities were more centrally located between two organizations.
Before we could consolidate these activities, we had to review the current resources, including staffing and information technology support systems to identify what the new
business model should include and to determine the best means to proceed with the consolidation.  Extensive reviews were conducted throughout the fiscal year and a
reorganization plan was completed that was implemented on November 11, 1999.
• Year 2000 Readiness Review .  The FCC conducted independent testing of all twenty-three mission-critical systems to verify that the systems were ready for the
millennium. The system tests were conducted by an independent contractor and tested on separate test hardware.  In addition, our Computer Security Office successfully
completed assessments of all our new major applications designed for use within the FCC network.  Eight application reviews were conducted to ensure compliance with
relevant OMB guidance on computer-based system development and management, including OMB Circular A-123, Management Accountability and Control, OMB
Circular A-27, Financial Management Systems, and OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources.
• Revisions to our Strategic Plan and Strategic Planning Process .  In March and May 1999, Chairman William Kennard, along with the other FCC Commissioners,
testified before our Congressional oversight committees.  As part of his testimony Chairman Kennard submitted a draft report, “A New FCC for the 21st Century.”  This
report served as a conceptual framework for FCC senior managers to meet and develop a new framework for our Strategic Plan.  Part of this process was a review of all our
organizations and functions to ascertain if they were still essential to the agency’s newly defined core functions.
We also gathered extensive input from our stakeholders through three public fora seeking the views of general industry, consumer, state, and local government
representatives, academic and organizational experts, and from Commission staff.  The feedback provided at these fora focused on similar themes: (1) universal service,
consumer protection and information; (2) enforcement and promotion of competitive markets domestically and worldwide; and (3) spectrum management.  We incorporated
many of these themes into the draft Strategic Plan that we submitted to Congress in August 1999 and in our draft Annual Performance Plan.
• Business Process Re-Engineering/Electronic Filing Initiatives .  In Fiscal Year 1999, the FCC completed planning for consolidating, streamlining and providing
electronic filing capabilities for all major Mass Media Bureau licensing systems.  Before design work could begin, a complete analysis of workload processes was
completed to identify outdated, duplicative, or unnecessary processes and procedures.  While all planning work was completed, system implementation was deferred due to
lack of adequate funding and the need to address higher priority, Year-2000 issues.

Restoration of Cell Phone Services: Hurricane Helene
On September 26, 2024, Hurricane Helene  made landfall 
near Perry, Florida. The hurricane caused flooding and 
damage to personal property and critical infrastru cture, 
including roads , power, and communication networks . The 
storm’s damage spread  across parts of Florida, Alabama, 
Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia. According 
to data reported to the  Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC)  by wireless service providers , while 
cell sites had been repaired in many counties  a week after 
the storm ( October 3, 2024 ), some counties ’ cell site 
outages persisted. Congress may examine public -private 
preparedness for communication outages from Hurric ane 
Helene and consider how to prepare  for and respond to 
future disasters and restore cell service in hard -hit regions.  
Some state and local officials  reported coordination with 
wireless service providers on preparation and restoration 
efforts; others, inc luding a mayor  and residents  in North 
Carolina, reportedly faulted public -private preparation 
efforts. Wireless providers reported on preparation and  
restoration efforts but noted challenges in some areas.  
Challenges derived from damaged critical infrastructure 
(e.g., roads) inhibiting access to cell sites , damage to cell 
towers and wire lines (e.g., fiber) that connect cell sites to a 
provider’s network , and lack of power to cell sites 
hindering permanent restoration.  
Federal Role in Restoring Cell Services  
Generally, wireless networks are privately owned. Network 
owners take responsibility for repair ing their networks and 
restor ing services for their customers (e.g., government 
agencies, businesses, indivi duals) after disasters.  
When authorized , the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency ( FEMA ) may deploy communication assets  to 
support federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial response 
(e.g., deploying mobile assets for emergency managers). 
FEMA also coordinates with the p rivate sector to aid in the 
restoration of private networks (e.g., coordinat ing debris 
removal to enable access to cell sites, shar ing information 
on power restoration).  
The FCC monitors the status of commercial networks and 
provides government officials and the public with 
information on the status of communications, outages, and 
restoration efforts. To do this, the FCC requires providers to 
report on the status of their networks during disasters.  
Disaster Information Reporting System  
In anticipation of a disaster or after an unexpected disaster, 
the FCC may activate the Disaster Information Reporting 
System  (DIRS). DIRS is  a web -based system that providers 
use to rep ort network status during disasters. The FCC 
announces DIRS activations through public notices and 
emails to providers; the notice lists the counties covered 
and reporting requirements. The FCC requires  providers to 
submit daily reports on their network status  for listed 
counties. The FCC gives network status data to federal emergency management officials. It also allows  designated 
state agencies to share the information with first responders, 
emergency communications centers, and other government 
agen cies with a public safety role. The FCC publishes 
aggregated outage data (e.g., communications status reports 
on the FCC’s Hurricane Helene website ). 
Mandatory Disaster Response Initiative  
The FCC can activate the  Mandatory Disaster Response 
Initiative  (MDRI) for facilities -based mobile wireless 
providers operating in a certain geographic area in the 
aftermath of a disaster. In June 20 22, the FCC adopted a 
Report and Order  codifying an existing voluntary 
agreement between a limited group of large wireless service 
providers agreeing to coord inate during disasters to enable 
access to communications  (called the Wireless Network 
Resiliency Cooperative Framework ). The rules  require 
providers to improve coordination during emergencies or 
disasters by   
• providing for reasonable roaming when feasible , 
• establishing mutual aid agreements with other wireless 
service providers ,  
• enhancing municipal preparedness and restoration ,  
• increasing consumer readiness and preparation , and  
• improving public awareness and stakeholder 
communications on service and resto ration status.  
FCC rules  require providers  to perform these tasks when 
MDRI is activated. The FCC may activate MDRI when  
• an authorized entity (e.g., FEMA) activates Emergency 
Support Function 2  (ESF -2)—a team of federal agencies 
designated to support restoration of communications;  
• the FCC activates DIRS; or  
• the FCC’s Public Safety and Homeland Securi ty Bureau 
Chief releases a public notice in response to a state’s 
request to activate MDRI, where that  state has activated 
its emergency operations center  or mutual aid 
agreements or has proclaimed a state of emergency.  
Hurricane Helene Response  
Private -sector wireless service providers  and the U.S. 
government, including FEMA and the FCC, took action 
before, during, and after Hurricane Helene to protect and 
restore communications infrastructure.  
Before  Hurricane Helene Made Landfall  
Days before landfall , the U.S. government and private 
telecommunication providers began preparing for Hurricane 
Helene’s arrival in the continental United States.  On 
September 24, 2024, FEMA announced  that it was actively 
preparing and pre -staging resources to support state and 
local government response, including Mobile Emergency Restoration of Cell Phone Services: Hurricane Helene  
https://crsreports.congress.gov  Response Support  (MERS), which include s mobile 
emergency  communications facilities , and incident teams .  
On September 25, 2024, the FCC announced  that at the 
request of the State of Florida, and in coordination with the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) 
and FEMA —the ESF -2 coordinators —it was activating 
DIRS and MDRI ahead of the hurricane for select counties 
in Florida, Georgi a, North Carolina, and South Carolina. 
For DIRS, the FCC required providers to report outages to 
the FCC in listed counties. With MDRI activation, the FCC 
required wireless providers operating in those  counties  to 
enable roaming across networks , coordinate  with each other 
and with state and local agencies on preparation and 
restoration efforts , and keep stakeholders and consumers 
informed of status and restoration efforts.   
Private telecommunication providers (e.g., AT&T , Verizon , 
and T-Mobile ) reported taking various actions to prepar e 
for the hurricane. They fortified their networks, refueling 
generators and providing backup batteries at cell sites and 
switching centers. They reported prepositioning mobile 
assets (e.g., satellite cell  on light trucks, satellite cell  on 
wheels)  and dep loying teams to the region. Providers 
indicated that they were coordinating with state and local 
governments and with their public safety customers and 
were ready to receive requests for assistance. The provide rs 
also were preparing and pre -staging equipme nt for 
deployment, and providers offered preparedness guidance 
to consumers.  
The FCC  reminded  public safety and national security and 
emergency preparedness personnel (NSEP) enrolled i n 
Priority Telecommunication Services  about the services 
available to enrollees. The program, managed by CISA, 
prioritizes (1) public safety communications on wireline 
and wireless networks and (2) restoration and provisioning 
of communication assets for NSEP. On September 26, 
2024, before the hurricane made landfall, the FCC posted 
its first communications status report , listing counties 
covered by DIRS, and began tracking outages .  
During and After Hurricane Helene  
On September 27, 2024, the FCC expanded  the activation 
area to include additional counties in South Carolina, 
Tennessee, and Virginia . It also began issuing daily 
communications status reports  with cell site outages in each 
affected state and county  and the percent age of cell sites 
down in each state during the DIRS activation  period 
(Figure 1).  
Figure 1. Percent age of Cell Sites Out of Service , by 
State  (September 27 to  October 3, 2024 ) 
 
Source: FCC, “Communications Status Report for Areas Impacted 
by Hurricane Helene ,” October 3, 2024 .  Notes:  The figure shows c ell site outages reported to the FCC by 
wireless service providers operating in certain counties affected by 
the storm. The number of site s out in a specific area does not 
necessarily correspond to the availability of wireless service to 
consumers in that area , due to overlapping cell sites that ma y provide 
coverage and temporary solutions deployed by providers to enable 
connectivity .  
Wireless service providers reported network outages to the 
FCC and on  their websites ; responded to public safety 
agency requests ; and in some areas , enabled roaming.  
On September 30, 2024, the FCC announced  deactivation 
of DIRS and MDRI for certain counties but retained DIRS 
reporting and MDRI coordination in others, as outages and 
restoration efforts continued . For example, in North 
Carolina, FEMA deployed  Starlink satellite systems in each 
county emergency operations center. The FCC waived 
eligibility requirements under its Lifeline  program, to offer 
discounted phones and broadband services to affected  
individuals , and continued to report on outages . 
While the FCC does not include information on specific 
vendors, an October 2, 2024 , media report  stated that 
Verizon and AT&T reported that 60% of their sites 
impacted by the storm had been restored and that they were 
continuing to deploy t emporary cell sites to enable 
communications. T-Mobile reported  that it had restored 
most sites in West Virginia and Georgia, but in t he 
Carolinas, where access  remain ed a challenge, restoration 
was ongoing . Where power was out, providers said they 
were continuing to supply batteries and fuel to generators. 
Where fiber lines were damaged, providers reported 
deploying mobile assets (satel lite cell  on wheels) and 
microwave solutions to temporarily restore networks. 
AT&T , Verizon , and T-Mobile  also offered charging 
stations and Wi -Fi in some areas. On October 6, 2024, the 
FCC granted  SpaceX and T -Mobile special temporary 
authority for Starlink direct -to-cell satellite services in 
certain areas to support emergency alerting.  
Issues for Congress  
On January 26, 2024, the FCC adopted rules  requiring 
facilities -based mobile wireless service providers to 
implement the MDRI requirements by May 1, 2024 . 
Congress may wish to explore potential lessons learned 
from implementation of the rule during Hurricane Helene, 
especially as implementing the rule  relates to preparedness, 
coordination, and roaming. In the past, Members have been 
interested in expanding outage reporting to in clude 
broadband outages ( H.R. 8178 , 117th Congress) , and the 
FCC has sought comment  on the issue. Congress may  
consider changes to outage reporting. Previous Congresses 
also have considered legislation to improve resiliency and 
redundancy of cell networks by mandating or subsidizing 
backup power to each cell site ( S. 1506 , 117th Congress) . 
While such investments could strengthen resiliency , 
provision of backup power sources could increase costs for 
providers and consumers. Finally, Congre ss could consider 
advantages and disadvantages  of expanded use of and 
federal support for advanced technologies, including drones 
and satellite technologies in rural regions to support 
communications.

Emergency Communications: Homeland 
Security Issues in the 116th Congress  
Updated January 29, 2019  
  
 
  
Overview  
First responders and other emergency personnel use emergency communications systems to communicate 
with each other during day -to-day operations and large -scale disasters. Emergency communication 
systems are also used to enable communications between the public and response agencies. Emergenc y 
communication systems include  
 911 systems  that receive calls from the public, requesting assistance or reporting an 
emergency , and that relay those calls to response agencies  (e.g., local police and fire 
departments) ; 
 land mobile radio (LMR) systems that allow police, firefighters, and emergency medical 
service (EMS) workers to commun icate with each other  during day-to-day operations and 
disasters ; 
 the First Responder Network ( FirstNet ), the nationwide public safety broadband network , 
which is currently under deployment and scheduled for completion in 2022, will enable 
response agencies at all levels o f government to communicate via voice and data (e.g., 
text, videos); and  
 alerting systems  that notify people of emergencies and warn people of danger.  
These systems  often rely on  different technologies  that can inhibit interoperability and response. For 
example, 911 systems are not able to send 911 text messages to first responders in the field. State and 
Congressional Research Service  
https://crsreports.congress.gov  
IN11028  Congressional Research Service  2 
  local police and fire age ncies use various radio technologies that can connect responders within their 
agency, but may not be interoperable with surrounding systems.  
Federal, state, and local public safety agencies are investing in Internet Protocol (IP) -based technologies 
to imp rove communications, coordination, and response. The federal government has created an IP -based 
national alerting system that allows authorized agenc ies to send a single alert through multiple alerting 
systems. The federal government has also invested in F irstNet, a nationwide seamless, IP -based, high -
speed mobile communications n etwork that will enable  public safety users  to communicate via voice and 
data with other public safety agencies. The re is also interest at all levels of government in upgrading 911 
systems to next generation , IP-based systems, to enable callers to share data and to  interconnect systems.  
Opportunities and Challenges of New Technologies  
As emergency communications systems  converge toward a common IP -based platform, there are 
opportun ities and challenges. Advancements in geo -location technologies present opportunities to find 
911 callers more easily; however, integration of these technologies into legacy 911 systems is challenging. 
Advancements in alerting have enabled officials to send alerts to mobile phones , yet some  people still rely 
on landline phones for communication s. Interconnecting systems could improve information sharing but 
presents challenges in terms of privacy and security of data flo wing across multiple networks.  
IP-based technologies enable emergency communications systems to interconnect, creating the potential 
for nationwide systems. The emergence of nationwide systems may create a need for new policies that 
integrate these new technologies into response plans and  protocols, and policies that support collaborative 
planning, training, and exercises across all levels of government to improve response.  
Further, migration to new technologies is costly. Not all jurisdictions  may be  able to fund technology 
upgrades. Ado ption of new technologies may also require upgrades to and investment s in emergency 
communications systems  and private telecommunications networks .  
Issues for the 116th Congress  
The 116th Congress may continue its oversight of the effectiveness of emergen cy communications before, 
during, and after natural or man -made disasters (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires), and the roles and 
responsibilities of federal, state, and local agencies, and private telecommunications providers during 
response. Congress may also  to examine the effectiveness of federal programs established to promote and 
support emergency communications , including   
 National 9 -1-1 Program  administered by the National Highway and Traff ic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation , which provides 
federal leadership and coordination in supporting and promoting optimal 911 services;   
 First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) , the federal authority within the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the U.S. Department of 
Commerce established to create the nationwide public safety broadband network ; 
 Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) , the national alerting system 
administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA);  
 Emergency Communications Division  in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ’s 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) , which is responsible for 
promoting interoperable and coordinated  communications across a ll levels of 
government ; and  
 federal grant programs  that fund emergency communications.Congressional Research Service  3 
IN11028  · VERSION 4 · NEW    
Congress may also focus on the activities of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC ) 
Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB) , which administers FCC pol icies related 
to emergency communications, includin g rules for carriers supporting 911 services ; state an d 
local use of 911 fees; public safety spectrum ; public alerts, including rules for carriers delivering 
wireless alerts to mobile phones ; disaster management and reporting of private network outages ; 
and restoration efforts .

FEMA Assistance: Limited English Proficiency and Equity
Individuals with Limited English Proficiency (LEP)  often 
encounter disproportionate risk during hazards  as well as 
barriers to federal relief . Statute requires t he Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA ; the lead agency  
for domestic emergency management)  to ensure that 
disaster relief reach es individuals with LEP. This In  Focus 
summarizes s elect  risks that language barriers impose 
during hazard response and recovery  (e.g., evacuation and 
sheltering), federal authorities addressing disaster relief for 
individuals with LEP, and recent  policy proposals  to 
enhance the delivery of federal relief for such individuals .  
Language Barri ers—Select Risks  
Language barriers may exacerbate the effects of hazards  
and hinder relief efforts  in the following ways : 
• Individuals with LEP may not understand e vacuation 
notices or instructions , raising the risk of casualty .  
• Individuals with LEP may not understand emergency 
relief providers , imped ing access to e mergency medical 
care, sheltering  assistance , and key relief commodities.  
• Individuals with LEP may not understand federal aid 
applications, written guidance, and oral instructions , 
deterring or delay ing their requests for relief  or yield ing 
insufficient awards. (FEMA  report s that it  can provide 
some assistance in English and Spanish , and contracts 
for assistance in additional languages , though some 
translations may be i naccurate or unintelligible. ) 
• Officials with LEP in state, local, tribal, and territorial 
governments (SLTTs ) and  nonprofits  may not 
understand relief instructions and procedures , inhibiting 
the delivery of critical assistance . 
Key Authorities  
Relevant  Statute s  
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires recipients 
of federal assistance to ensure that  persons with LEP have 
meaningful access to such assistance. Additionally, Section 
308 of the  Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
Emergen cy Assistance Act (the Staffor d Act, P.L. 93 -288, 
as amended)  require s the issuance of  regulations  ensuring  
the provision of disaster relief without discrimination , 
includin g based on  English proficiency.  
In 2006,  the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform 
Act (PKEMRA,  P.L. 109 -295) amended the Stafford Act . It 
require d the FEMA Administrator to (1) work with SLTTs 
to identify LEP populations and ensure that they are 
incorporated into the disaster planning process , (2) ensure 
that such populations could access  disaster relief 
information, and (3) develop and maintain a da tabase on 
successful language assistance programs that could be 
provided to SLTTs during an incident ( 42 U.S.C. §5196f ).  FEMA Regulations  and Agency Notices  
FEMA issued regulations implementing  statutory civil 
rights obligations for federal disaster relie f at 44 C.F.R. 
§206.11  and 44 C .F.R. Part 7. Per these regulations, entities  
receiving most forms of FEMA assistance (e.g., SLTTs and 
nonprofits) may not discriminate a gainst individuals on the 
basis of national origin, among other grounds , when 
administer ing such relief  (LEP is not explicitly mentioned) . 
FEMA may refuse or terminate financial assistance in cases 
of noncompliance. Additionally, neither federal personnel 
nor agencies may discriminate against individuals when  
providing federal disaster assistance.  
In 2011,  the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS ) 
released guidance for agency components, including FEMA 
(“2011 DHS  Notice ”; 76 Federal Register  21755 ). The 
guidance (1) details federal assistance recipients’ 
respo nsibilities  to ensure access to  individuals with LEP 
and (2) explains how DHS evaluates compliance.  
Federal Communications  Commission (FCC)  
State and local agencies can send emergency alerts through 
FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning System 
(IPAWS), which distributes alerts via radio, television, cell 
phones, and other means. FEMA coordinates with the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which 
regulates commercial broadcast and mobile service 
providers  that elect to participate in emergen cy alerting . 
The FCC has adopted rules for the Emergency Alert System 
(EAS), which delivers alerts via television and radio (47 
C.F.R. Part 11), and the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) 
system, used by mobile service providers to send alerts to 
cell phones (47 C.F.R. Part 10) . FCC mandates that EAS 
broadcasters providing foreign language programming 
should transmit EAS announcements in the primary 
language of the EAS participant (47 C.F.R. §11.55(c)(4)). 
The FCC also requires EAS participants to report actio ns 
taken or planned to reach non -English -speaking audiences 
to help states acquire information on how best to 
disseminate multilingual alerts (47 C.F.R. §11.55(d)). In 
2016, t he FCC adopted WEA rules (47 C.F.R. §10.480) 
requiring wireless service providers to transmit WEA  alerts 
issued in Spanish , or that contain Spanish -language 
characters, to cell phone users who specify Spanish as their 
preferred language. Local government  official s and LEP 
stakeholders have urged the FCC to improve multilingual  
EAS and WEA alerting.  In February 2023, a letter signed  
by 45 Members  from both chambers of Congress urged the 
FCC  to expand the number of WEA languages. In April 
2023 , the FCC adopted a  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
that would require providers that send WEA alerts to ensure 
mobile devices can translate alerts into the 13 most 
commonly spoken languages in the United States, and 
support American Sign Language and speech -to-text. The 
rules are pending.   FEMA Assistance: Limited English Proficiency and Equity  
https://crsreports.congress.gov  Executive Orders  
On August 11, 2000 , President Clinton  signed Executive 
Order (E.O.) 13166, Improving Access to English Services 
for Persons with Limited English Proficiency,  which  
requires federal agencies to examine the services they 
provide and develop and implement a system to provide  
individuals with LEP  “meaningful access” to agency 
services. The E.O. builds on  the prohibitions on 
discrimination due to national origin in  Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, as amended . E.O. 13166 directs all 
agencies providing federal financial assista nce to prepare a 
Language Access Plan (LAP)  to improve access to 
programs by eligible individuals with LEP. The E.O.  
further  directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to oversee 
agency compliance and consistency in implementation.  
Through DOJ guidance , agencies and recipients of federal 
financial assistance must  assess “meaningful access” to 
their programs and activities through a four -factor analysis:  
1. The number or proportion of individuals 
with LEP served or encountered in the 
service population;  
2. The frequency of contact  with individuals 
with LEP ; 
3. The nature and importance of the 
program; and  
4. The agency’s available resources.  
DOJ explains, “Applying the four factors, for example, a 
small police department with limited resources 
encountering very few L EP people has far fewer language 
assistance responsibilities than larger departments with 
more resources and large populations of LEP individuals.” 
(66 Federal Register 3834) . 
FEMA Policy  and Guidance  
In 2016, FEMA issued a LAP (updated in 2023) to comply 
with E.O. 13166. The LAP explains how  FEMA conducts  
assessments to identify affected LEP individuals following 
a Stafford Act declaration. The 2016 LAP reported  that 
FEMA  releases some relevant information to disaster 
survivors in different lan guages based on  these assessments,  
including  “Civil Rights Notices” that ackn owledge the  right 
of individuals with LEP to receive accessible 
communication , and notice that FEMA can provide 
interpreter services in  up to  69 languages (at certain 
locations ). FEMA’s abbreviated 2023 LAP  reported that the 
agency is to provide  oral and written services to LEP 
individuals, and notices of the availability of such services.  
Select  Policy Issues  
Establishing Trust Across  Language Barriers  
Language barriers may undermine  trust between disaster 
survivors and emergency responders , jeopardizing 
evacuation and relief efforts . For example , some  
immigrants with LEP may avoid government officials due 
to fears of immigration surveillance and enforce ment.  
Implementation Gaps and FEMA Capacity  
FEMA’s bilingual workforce has  sometimes  fallen short of  
demand  in post -disaster areas. For example, FEMA  did not 
have  sufficient Spanish -speaking  staff to serve survivors  in 
Puerto Rico following Hurricane Marí a (GAO -18-472). 
Such shortfalls may be particularly common  when  concurrent disasters require  limited FEMA  personnel  to 
deploy to multiple regions. FEMA may require additional 
appropriations  to support  more  bilingual  permanent  staff, 
short -term reservists, or translators , though some contracted 
translations have been notably inaccurate.   
Recent  Policy Recommendations  
Federal  Hiring for Language Competency  
The 2022 inaugural report of President Joseph R. Biden’s 
Advisory Commission on Asian Americans, Native 
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (the Commission) called 
upon the Office of Personnel Management to provide 
guidance on hiring bilingual staff, interpreters, and 
translators to federal agencies that di rectly provide federal 
disaster assistance . Other experts also recommended hiring 
local residents that share survivors’ cultures and languages .  
New Requirements for Federal Grant ees 
The Commission’s report also called upon FEMA to  revise 
requirements for  SLTTs  receiving federal assistance . 
Specifically, the Commission recommended that FEMA 
require such entities  to identify LEP commun ities and detail 
how they will ensure meaningful access  to federal relief in 
those c ommunities.  Currently, DHS recommends sim ilar 
actions to establish compliance with federal civil rights 
requirements ( see 2011 DHS Notice). The Commission 
suggested incorporatin g requirements into grant terms, 
scoring methods, and notices of funding opportunities.   
Incorporate LEP Communities int o Planning  
Federal and nonfederal  stakeholders and experts 
recommend  that preparedness and planning efforts include 
individuals with LEP  (and representative organizations)  to 
ensure sufficient consideration of their needs .  
Direct Outreach  to Affected Populations  
A recent coalition of groups representing disaster survivors  
(e.g., Ayuda Legal Puerto Rico)  recommended that FEMA 
provide assistance notices and application guidance through 
door-to-door campaigns to affected, hard -to-reach 
popula tions, particularly LEP individuals. FEMA supported  
similar outreach efforts during the  COVID -19 pandemic 
and Hurricane Ian.  Some entities use commercial o ff-the-
shelf  alerting systems that offer multilingual alerting 
options. However , these systems  often require people 
subscribe or opt -in and do not send alerts to non-
subscribers, including individuals passing through an area .  
Data on Language Outreach  
FEMA’s National Advisory Council (an advisory body of 
representatives from SLTT governments, emergency 
management professionals and experts, and populations 
with special needs) proposed  that FEMA track  the 
languages used to reach survivors  as part of an effort to 
assess the equitability of different agency programs.

Emergency Communications: Homeland 
Security Issues in the 116th Congress  
Updated January 29, 2019  
  
 
  
Overview  
First responders and other emergency personnel use emergency communications systems to communicate 
with each other during day -to-day operations and large -scale disasters. Emergency communication 
systems are also used to enable communications between the public and response agencies. Emergenc y 
communication systems include  
 911 systems  that receive calls from the public, requesting assistance or reporting an 
emergency , and that relay those calls to response agencies  (e.g., local police and fire 
departments) ; 
 land mobile radio (LMR) systems that allow police, firefighters, and emergency medical 
service (EMS) workers to commun icate with each other  during day-to-day operations and 
disasters ; 
 the First Responder Network ( FirstNet ), the nationwide public safety broadband network , 
which is currently under deployment and scheduled for completion in 2022, will enable 
response agencies at all levels o f government to communicate via voice and data (e.g., 
text, videos); and  
 alerting systems  that notify people of emergencies and warn people of danger.  
These systems  often rely on  different technologies  that can inhibit interoperability and response. For 
example, 911 systems are not able to send 911 text messages to first responders in the field. State and

  local police and fire age ncies use various radio technologies that can connect responders within their 
agency, but may not be interoperable with surrounding systems.  
Federal, state, and local public safety agencies are investing in Internet Protocol (IP) -based technologies 
to imp rove communications, coordination, and response. The federal government has created an IP -based 
national alerting system that allows authorized agenc ies to send a single alert through multiple alerting 
systems. The federal government has also invested in F irstNet, a nationwide seamless, IP -based, high -
speed mobile communications n etwork that will enable  public safety users  to communicate via voice and 
data with other public safety agencies. The re is also interest at all levels of government in upgrading 911 
systems to next generation , IP-based systems, to enable callers to share data and to  interconnect systems.  
Opportunities and Challenges of New Technologies  
As emergency communications systems  converge toward a common IP -based platform, there are 
opportun ities and challenges. Advancements in geo -location technologies present opportunities to find 
911 callers more easily; however, integration of these technologies into legacy 911 systems is challenging. 
Advancements in alerting have enabled officials to send alerts to mobile phones , yet some  people still rely 
on landline phones for communication s. Interconnecting systems could improve information sharing but 
presents challenges in terms of privacy and security of data flo wing across multiple networks.  
IP-based technologies enable emergency communications systems to interconnect, creating the potential 
for nationwide systems. The emergence of nationwide systems may create a need for new policies that 
integrate these new technologies into response plans and  protocols, and policies that support collaborative 
planning, training, and exercises across all levels of government to improve response.  
Further, migration to new technologies is costly. Not all jurisdictions  may be  able to fund technology 
upgrades. Ado ption of new technologies may also require upgrades to and investment s in emergency 
communications systems  and private telecommunications networks .  
Issues for the 116th Congress  
The 116th Congress may continue its oversight of the effectiveness of emergen cy communications before, 
during, and after natural or man -made disasters (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires), and the roles and 
responsibilities of federal, state, and local agencies, and private telecommunications providers during 
response. Congress may also  to examine the effectiveness of federal programs established to promote and 
support emergency communications , including   
 National 9 -1-1 Program  administered by the National Highway and Traff ic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. Department of Transportation , which provides 
federal leadership and coordination in supporting and promoting optimal 911 services;   
 First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) , the federal authority within the National

Digital Liberty appreciates this opportunity to submit comments on the Commission’s Notice of 
Inquiry regarding usage -based billing in broadband internet services. Our comments will focus 
upon the viability  and fairness of this billing method  within the broadband industry, the ways in 
which it can  empower consumer choice, and why regulatory intervention to abolish it would be 
counterproductive to the long -term deployment  of broadband service . Lastly, we will provide 
insight on various legal deterrents to banning usage -based billing .  
Usage -based billing is neither new nor unique to the American economy. Whether it is the 
amount of electricity generated, gas burned, or water run on a monthly basis, every American is 
acquainted with the billing system for usage -based home utilities. The broadband industry should 
be treated no differently. For decades, internet service providers (ISPs) have offered consumers 
tiered pricing options to fit their unique needs, allowing Americans to access high -speed 
broadband at practical price points. For co nsumers who require more bandwidth, such as remote 
workers or families with children engaged in online learning, unlimited data plans are available 
at a higher premium. For consumers who require lower  bandwidth capacity, ISPs offer a 
multitude of data -capped broadband plans for the dynamic budgets of everyday Americans. This 
diversity of options benefits consumers and should not be outlawed under a theory of fairness 
that does not comport with customer experience.  
For decades, usage -based billing has been a cornerstone of efficient and affordable broadband  
access for countless Americans. By enabling ISPs to regulate pricing models through traditional 
free-market principles, broadband providers are incentivized to engage in robust competition. 
Through this competitive pricing landscape, individual ISPs are c hallenged to do more with less, 
rather than languishing under anti -competitive, fixed -rate regimes that erode network 
performance and cripple innovation.  
According to a recent study published by the International Center for Law and Economics 
(ICLE), usage -based billing allows ISPs to “better manage network congestion, ensure fair 
allocation of network resources, and…recover large, fixed costs associated wit h building, 
maintaining and upgrading broadband infrastructure.”1 Through these substantive network 
improvements, usage -based billing guarantees the existence of competitive ISPs markets. Armed 
with a perpetual incentive to outperform competitors, ISPs leverage profits derived from usage -
based billing to continually rei nvest in improved broadband offerings. As  the ICLE study 
concludes, usage -based billing can therefore “foster fairness and economic efficiency” within 
ISP markets, while also supporting “broadband affordability and, in turn, [fostering] increased

Pricing . International Center for Law and Economics. https://laweconcenter.org/resources/the -economics -of-
broadband -data-caps-and-usage -based -pricing/  adoption.”2 Driven by a need to outperform competitors, usage -based billing therefore 
encourages ISPs to continually invest in network maintenance, broadband innovation and 
territorial expansion, propelling the industry as a whole forward.  
Over the past two decades, broadband advancements generated by robust ISP competition have 
delivered substantive savings for consumers as well. As previously noted, the fruits of usage -
based billing models have been continually channeled into further broad band investment 
throughout the United States, with ISPs funneling an inflation adjusted average of $95 billion 
annually into new infrastructure from 2002 to 2022.3 This consistent level of reinvestment has 
redounded to the  substantial  benefit for consumers, who have seen usage -based broadband prices 
plummet in recent years. According to an annual pricing index published by USTelecom, 
broadband costs for popular speed tiers fell by 54.7% from 2015 to 2023, while high -speed tiers 
fell by  55.8% over the same period.4 For this reason, the notion that data caps represent a barrier 
to broadband consumer access is fundamentally false. Rather, the revenue generated from usage -
based billing has actually facilitated a transformative level of ISP reinvestment, propelling 
industry innovation and slashing costs for American consumers.   
While usage -based billing offers an abundance of benefits for both ISPs and American 
consumers, banning the practice  would exact irreparable damage upon the broadband industry. 
Through universal access to unlimited data, ISPs would be stripped of the ability to bar high -
level broadband users from monopolizing network resources. As the Commission concluded in a 
2010 Orde r, “requiring all subscribers to pay the same amount for broadband service, regardless 
of the performance or usage of the service, would for ce light end users of the network to 
subsidize heavier end users.”5 Under this dynamic, two undesirable situations could arise. In an 
effort to “cross subsidize” unchecked heavy -user activity, ISPs could raise fixed -rate broadband 
costs for all users, forcing low -level users to endure inflated prices and lower quality ser vice. 
Alternatively, ISPs could keep fixed -rates frozen, instead choosing to operate at a deficit that will 
impact long -term network efficiency, infrastructure investment and regional expansion. Either 
way, the abolition of data caps will ensure that Ameri can consumers will foot a higher bill for a 
lesser product.  
Simply put, it is illogical to expect high -level, sustainable ISP performance under a fixed -rate 
model that ignores the traditional counterbalance of supply and demand. When consumers are

Broadband Industry Practices. https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC -10-201A1.pdf  granted unmitigated access to a product through misguided government intervention, 
discretionary pricing is permanently eradicated. In its place, collectivist subsidization of heavy -
end users is the only remedy for network resource abuse. Worse yet, if pri ces are artificially 
frozen, an inevitable operating deficit will prevent ISPs from leveraging once -plentiful resources 
to offer a superior product. For these reasons, usage -based billing is a better system  than its 
interventionist counterparts. As former FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski has explained , 
“business innovation to promote network investment and efficient use of networks, including 
measures to match price to cost such as usage -based pricing” are critically important to keep 
ISPs in fighting form.6  
Nevertheless, even if one still maintains that the abolition of usage -based billing  is an 
economically feasible possibility, the FCC has no basis to interfere with this area of commerce. 
No American consumer has been harmed through his or her use of a voluntary, usage -priced  
broadband plan. If anything, usage -based billing has been demonstrated to offer abundant 
benefits to American consumers through efficient network maintenance, innovation investments 
and affordable accessibility. Without the existence of  demonstrable harm, agency intervention 
into a natural free -market transaction would be unnecessary and misguided. Additionally, as 
Digital Liberty has previously highlighted, “under the Roberts Court’s current jurisprudence on 
the major questions doctrine , the FCC would almost certainly exceed its authority in this matter 
if it tried to intervene.”7 For these reasons, an FCC abolition of broadband data caps would invite 
a swift rebuke from the federal judiciary, resulting in an inconclusive waste of taxpayer 
resources on a misguided whim.  
Broadband data caps are more than a simple pricing mechanism. They are an essential medium 
for robust ISP competition, advanced network quality, and substantive consumer savings within 
the broadband industry. Through flexible pricing autonomy, Americans ca n access broadband 
services that align with their unique needs, enabling households to pay their fair share, rather 
than subsidizing heavy -end users. Furthermore, this dynamic preserves a competitive ISP 
marketplace,  where  individual providers  are motivate d to enhance service quality, expand 
network capabilities, and reinvest in cutting -edge infrastructure.  The Commission should leave 
well enough alone with a system that not only works but benefits consumers and is possibly 
beyond its current remit to prohibit .  
Digital Liberty thanks the Commission for the opportunity to comment on this matter, and we 
commend the Commission for seeking public feedback in the associated proceeding .

Mr. Latta.   Good morning.  The subcommittee will come to order.  And the 
chair recognizes himself for an opening statement.  
Good morning and welcome to today's oversight hearing of the Federal 
Communications Commission.  This is the third time we have had the FCC before us this 
Congress and I am pleased that we are maintaining a cadence of consistent oversight hearings.   
I want to first by starting -- again to once again offer our condolences to the 
chairwoman for the loss and passing of your father.  We hope that your memories of him have helped you cope during this very difficult time.  And although we can disagree on policy, we can come together to share each others' grief.  So on behalf of the committee we are very sorry on his passing.  
The last time the FCC was before us we discussed its role in President Biden's 
broadband takeover and its overregulation of the communications industry.  
Unfortunately, the agency has continued down this path.   
Earlier this year the FCC voted to reclassify broadband as a common carrier under 
Title II of the Communications Act under the guise of net neutrality.  This action expands 
the FCC's authority over broadband along agency to impose burdensome regulations that 
will make it harder for proprietors to deploy broadband.   
As I stated before, this action is absolutely unnecessary.  In 2017, after the FCC 
reversed the Obama FCC's re -classification of broadband, the Democrats told the world 
that we would get the internet one  word at a time and that the internet as we knew it 
would end.  As we all know, none of these fears came true.  In fact, the day after the order was going in on rescinding it, I asked my office to keep track of how many of my This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 constituents called in after the repeal to say they have lost their internet and I received 
zero calls.   
Instead, broadband networks thrived because of increased investment by private 
companies that has led to higher speeds and lower prices.  Indeed our networks survived the automa test when they withstood increased usage as a result of COVID- 19 
pandemic when almost every aspect of everyday life went online.  Contrast what happened in the United States to what happened in Europe where regulators had to ask websites like YouTube and Netflix to throttle and degrade services to withstand the 
increased demand.   
At our last hearing, the chairwoman attributed our successes to States enacting 
their own net neutrality policies, that couldn't be further from the truth.  The internet 
continued to function normally between the repeal and the States enacting their own 
laws.  Only a few States enacted and none enacted anything close to utility -style 
regulations that the FCC repealed and is now reimposing.  The true source of success for 
our networks is the light -touch regulatory framework that the FCC just moved away from.  
This action is just one of the many taken by the FCC to hinder U.S. leadership and 
technology.  The affect of these decisions is that deploying broadband and providing service will be more challenging for providers.   
These actions could not come at a worse time, Congress has provided $42.5  billion 
to close the digital divide to the Commission is undermining that effort by imposing 
regulations that will make it more expensive and more burdensome to deploy.  They 
should be doing the opposite.  I urge the FCC to reverse course and restore the light -touch regulatory environment that allowed broadband investment to thrive.   
I have many questions about the direction the Commission is taking.  I thank the This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 commissioners for being here today and I look forward to discussing this and these other 
very important questions that will before the Commission.   
And I will yield back the balance of my time.  I now recognize the ranking 
member of the subcommittee, my colleague, the gentlelady from California's Seventh District for an opening statement.  
[The prepared statement of Mr. Latta follows:]

Ms. Matsui.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
And Madam Chairwoman, I too often my deepest condolences upon your loss.   
Today's hearing comes at a critical moment as the FCC must tackle challenges with 
far reaching impacts on U.S. consumers and competitiveness.  I am glad that this FCC 
has taken needed steps to expand broadband connectivity, deliver on net neutrality and strengthen cybersecurity among other urgent priorities.  I am especially excited about the FCC's recently announced cybersecurity pilot program for schools and libraries.   
Cyber attacks on our schools are only growing in frequency and sophistication.  
From 2016 to 2022 alone our K -12 schools suffered over 1,600 cyber attacks.  According 
to the GAO, every cyber attack at high schools districts cost tens of thousands and even up to millions of dollars.  That is why I introduced Enhancing K -12 Cybersecurity Act to 
improve school access to cybersecurity resources and nationwide tracking of K -12 cyber 
attacks.   
That is also why I have long urged the FCC to modernize cyber tools for schools by 
adopting a pilot program.  The FCC has taken a positive step toward improving K -12 
cybersecurity and I look forward to continuing to work with you on this issue.  
Whether this is cybersecurity or other challenges, we know we have more work 
ahead of us.  As a subcommittee we should be building up the FCC's ability to protect consumers and oversee our networks.  The stakes are simply too high for Congress to 
undermine the FCC's progress.  That is why this subcommittee and Congress must push 
forward on the unfinished work before us and fully empower the FCC to do its job.   
First, millions of American families are counting on Congress to keep them 
connected.  Yet as of last month, the Affordable Connectivity Program ran out of funds.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
7 
 That means more than 23 million households nationwide have lost the support they need 
to access affordable, high- quality broadband.   
The end of the ACP puts our low- income families at risk.  According to an FCC 
survey over two -thirds of ACP households reported having inconsistent or zero 
connectivity before ACP.  We can't afford to take a leap backwards and request to close the digital divide.  That is why I and more than half of the House support the ACP Extension Act.  Similarly, we can't afford to leave unsecured Chinese gear in our communications networks.  Congress must resolve the funding shortfall for the Rip and 
Replace Program to ensure we can remove every piece of vulnerable equipment from 
American networks.   
Earlier this month, the FCC reported that nearly 40  percent of Rip and Replace 
funding with recipients said they can't finish replacement work without full funding for the program.  These providers are at risk of shutting down their networks or withdrawing from the Rip and Replace Program.  This is unacceptable.  We must act to 
curb this risk to our consumers and national security.  I am committed to keeping ACP 
and Rip and Replace funded.  Let's work together to ensure these critical bipartisan programs do not fall by the wayside.  
And finally, I want to briefly discuss another urgent matter, renewing the FCC's 
spectrum option authority.  I know I am not the only member of the subcommittee frustrated by how more than a year later the FCC is still ham stringed in its ability to drive 
innovation through a healthy spectrum pipeline.  At a time when the FCC is renewing 
focus on 6G and other innovative technologies that rely on spectrum, we can't afford delay.  We need the FCC fully empowered with option authority and the Federal Government working to advance a unified U.S. spectrum position on the global stage.   This is an unedited transcript.

 With that, I want to thank the chairwoman and commissioners for appearing 
before us today and I yield the balance of my time.

Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady yields back.  The chair now recognizes 
for 5  minutes the ranking member --  the chair of the full committee.  
The Chair.   I would be the chair.  I am still the chair.  
Mr. Latta.   No, I am sorry.  I was just thinking that I have to recognize the 
gentlelady from Michigan because the ranking member is not here.  Sorry about that.  
But the chair of the full committee, the gentlelady from Washington for 5  minutes.  
The Chair.   Good morning thank you Chairman Latta, chairwomen, 
commissioners welcome back.  Bridging the digital divide is one of this committee's top priorities and it is the FTC's statutory responsibility to assist us in that effort.  But unfortunately, the FCC has been failing in its mission.  The commission's recent action to reclassify broadband internet access as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act, as well as the agency's broad rules on digital discrimination have undermined our efforts to ensure every American has access to broadband.   
This could not come at a worse time.  We are on the verge of closing the digital 
divide.  Congress has dedicated billions of dollars to achieve this effort, including $42 billion for the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program at the National Telecommunications and Information Agency.  Those efforts are undercut when the Commission then places every handed regulations and micromanages providers, making it harder to encourage participation in these programs to deploy and operate new 
networks and get more people connected.   
As has already been proven once, Title II is a solution in search of a problem.  It is 
a century -old framework designed it address telephone monopolies, whereas today's 
broadband marketplace is incredibly competitive.  These regulations will hurt This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

10 
 consumers most, resulting in higher prices and slower internet speeds.   
The FCC has failed to learn from previous efforts and has no legitimate jurisdiction 
for these heavy handed regulations.   
The talking points that these regulations protect consumers from harmful ISP 
practices are not rooted in fact and have already been disproven once by the incredible 
performance of our networks, especially in the wake of the COVID -19 pandemic.   
The facts are that speeds are up, investment and broadband networks is up, and 
prices for consumers are down.  The fast lanes blocking and throttling the traffic that 
Democrats warned about never transpired.  Our light -touch regulatory environment 
works.  And turning away from this success with unnecessary regulations is wrongful 
action.   
Reclassifying broadband under Title II is not only bad policy, it is also unlawful.  
As the Republicans on this committee and the Senate commerce committee wrote to the Commission before its decision.  The FCC has no authority to reclassify broadband.  
That is Congress' job, as the Supreme Court recently confirmed.   
The FCC doesn't get to just claim something is necessary for American national 
security in order to do whatever they want.  That is for Congress decide, as it has in 
numerous instances recently with things like our TikTok legislation establishing the Rip and Replace Program and passing the Secure Equipment Act.  The decision on how to regulate broadband can have significant economic and political consequences requires 
the FCC to have clear authorization from Congress in order to act.   
When it comes to Title II, we have given the Commission no such authority.  This 
is not the first time this FCC has exceeded their authority.  Last December the agency 
approved rules on data breach notification.  That mirrors the rule that Congress This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

11 
 disapproved of in 2017 through the Congressional Review Act procedures.  The CRA 
forbids the FCC from enacting rules that are substantially the same as those Congress 
rejected.  And now the FCC has circulated an order that would regulate the use of 
artificial intelligence in political ads.  A task that does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Commission which drew condemnation from the Federal Election Commission, the independent agency who does hold that authority.  This pattern of the FCC abusing its authority and ignoring congressional direction is just another example of the Biden administration's efforts to assert more Federal control over the American people's lives.  
This must end and I look forward to the courts stepping in to he overturn these unlawful 
power grabs.  This agency is pursuing a partisan agenda that ignores Congress and fails to solve the actual problems impacting Americans like illegal robocalls or permitting 
reform to help deploy broadband faster or additional ways to secure our networks from the threats posed by our adversaries.   
Today's hearing presents an opportunity to hold the FCC accountable for its 
actions.  I look forward it our discussion.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Mr. Latta.   Thank you very much.  The chair yields back the balance of her time.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Michigan's Sixth District for an 
opening statement for 5  minutes.  
Mrs. Dingell.   Thank you, Mr.  Chair.  I am giving the Ranking Member Pallone's 
opening statement today.   
We are here today conducting important oversight of the Federal 
Communications Commission and its budget for the upcoming year.  We commend the 
FCC under the leadership of chairwoman Rosenworcel for putting the American people at 
the heart of every decision it has made over the last 3  years.   
The FCC has consistently prioritized work to protect consumers, promote public 
safety and enhance national security in our communications sector, leading the way towards a digital future that is safe and secure for all Americans.  Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the FCC's adoption of a net neutrality protections.  This action 
corrected the Trump era FCC's misguided rollback of commonsense rules for an open 
internet.  We strongly support the reinstatement of this authority.  The agency rectified a massive dereliction of its duty and extended bedrock consumer protections to broadband internet access that our Nation has always applied to communication services.   
The FCC's actions will result in greater oversight over internet providers to 
mitigate network outages, resolve broadband consumer complaints, prevent 
anti-consumer and anti -competitive practices and protect our national security.  
The FCC is also playing a major role in the implementation of the broadband 
investments President Biden and congressional Democrats delivered as part of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  In May, the FCC released its fourth major update to the National This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 Broadband Map which serves as the backbone the historic $42 billion investment to bring 
high speed, affordable broadband to communities overlooked for too long.  Not one 
Republican on this subcommittee voted in favor of that bill and yet they continue to 
attack it and jeopardize its success at every opportunity.   
We are also likely to hear today attacks from Republican commissioners against 
the implementation of the BEAD program.  These attacks fail to recognize that this is the largest investment in broadband deployment in our Nation's history.  And we want to make sure that we get it right.  I would think we would all agree with that.  These 
attacks are only going to hurt communities throughout the entire Nation that have either 
been unserved or underserved for too long.   
As part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we also created the Affordable 
Connectivity Program, which has made broadband more affordable for 23 million American families.  I commend the FCC for successfully implementing this program and working to get eligible families signed up.   
Unfortunately, House Republican leadership allowed the program to lapse last 
month, leaving all of these families with the very difficult decision of paying higher internet bills every month and many of them can't afford it, pure and simple, can't afford it or they lose the service all together.  Extending the popular Affordable Connectivity Program should be something that Democrats and Republicans can agree on.  After all, it benefits red and blue districts alike and I look forward someday to us going back to just 
being Americans, including rural, urban and suburban communities.   
I would also like to commend the chairwoman for recently proposing that any 
political ads containing content generated using artificial intelligence must disclose that 
fact.  This approached requirement will help viewers better understand how political This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 campaigns are attempting to influence them.   
We appreciate the chairwoman's efforts on the subject and will continue to 
support efforts to increase transparency around campaign ads and the use of AI finally.   
Finally, there is increasing concern about extreme and Republican efforts to 
destroy agencies like the FCC and the important role it plays on behalf of the public in 
overseeing critical services like our communication networks.  These Republican attacks against our Federal agencies would be devastating for consumers and would only help powerful companies to increase their profits even more.  Trump's Project 2025 plan, 
authored in part by a Republican commissioner before us today would exasperate these 
consumer harms by eliminating expert agencies, gutting the civil service and consolidating power under the President.  This will have serious negative consequences for 
Americans, leading to higher prices, lower quality services and decreased safety and security.  We simply cannot allow that to happen.  So I appreciate the FCC's work in protecting American consumers and I thank the commissioners for being here today.  
Since I have almost no time left, I yield back the balance of it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 STATEMENT OF JESSICA ROSENWORCEL  
 
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Chair Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you to discuss our budget effort, and effort to build a digital future that works for everyone.   
Since I appeared before you last year a lot has happened at the FCC.  Let me start 
with this, we won an Emmy.  The academy honored the FCC for its work repurposing broadcast airwaves for new wireless uses.  I am going to bet that makes us unique among agencies in Washington.  We are also unique because we get a lot done.   
So beyond the bright lights and red carpet let me tell you about it.  First, the FCC 
is working to connect everyone everywhere.  We built the Affordable Connectivity Program, the largest broadband affordability effort in our Nation's history, 23 million households rely on it, but funding expired in May and we need Congress to continue it.   
Second, the FCC is working to protect consumers and enhance competition.  In 
April we took steps to ensure that the Nation's expert communications authority has 
basic oversight over the most essential communications of our time by reinstating net 
neutrality because every consumer deserves internet access that a fast, open and fair.   
We introduced new broadband nutrition labels so consumers can compare service 
plans.  We launched the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark so consumers have confidence Internet This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 of Things devices.  And next week we are voting on a proposal to unlock wireless phones 
because you bought the phone, you should be able to use it with any carrier you choose.   
Third, the FCC created the National Broadband Map, this map is the most accurate 
data we have telling us where broadband is and is not.  We need funding for the Broadband DATA Act to continue because this map is how we ensure accountability for all new broadband spending.   
Fourth, the FCC is making connectivity more accessible.  Last year we kicked off a 
proceeding to make video conferencing services accessible to people with disabilities.  
We also improved wireless emergency alerts, making them available in more than a 
dozen languages.   
Fifth, the FCC is working to connect the most vulnerable.  We implemented the 
Safe Connections Act helping survivors of domestic violence get secure communications they need.  And we proposed to add a new missing and endangered persons code for emergency alerts so we can help save more lives, especially in Tribal communities.   
Sixth, the FCC is connecting families.  Next week we will vote to implement the 
Martha Wright -Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act which will significantly 
lower rates for phone calls for those who are incarcerated and their kin.   
Seventh, the FCC securing your communications.  For the first time in history we 
are have revoked the authorization to provide telecommunication services in the United States for four Chinese companies.  This action will soon include broadband and not just 
voice service.   
In May, we proposed plans to mitigate internet routing vulnerabilities identified 
by DOJ, DHS and DOD.  On top of this, we continue to work to remove Huawei and ZTE 
equipment in our networks.  But without more funding, carriers may not be able to This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 complete the process, threatening national security and risking the shut down of rural 
networks.   
Eighth, the FCC is doubling down on efforts to stop scam robocalls and rotexts.  
We made clear that AI generated robocalls are illegal, issued hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and are now working with 49 State Attorneys General to get this junk off the line.  But we need more authority from Congress to keep these scam artists at bay.   
Ninth, the FCC is supporting the growing space economy.  There is been a huge 
increase in the number and complexity of applications for satellite services.  In response 
we created the Space Bureau, streamlined satellite processing, freed spectrum for 
commercial space launches and established a first of its kind in the world framework for the coming convergence of satellite and terrestrial services, we call it the single network 
future.   
And last but not least, the FCC is working to free up more spectrum for 5G, 6G and 
beyond.  But to do this, we need Congress to restore the agency's action authority.  For 
the first time in 3  decades we do not have it.  Restoring this authority will provide the 
United States with the strongest foundation to compete in a global economy, counter our 
adversaries technology ambitions and safeguard our national security.   
And using this authority we won and Emmy award, bring it back and let's see what 
we can do with it next.   
So those are some of things that the FCC is doing to build a digital future that 
works for everyone.  I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

Mr. Latta.   Well, thank you very much for your testimony.  
Commissioner Carr, you are recognized for 5 minutes for an opening statement.  
 
STATEMENT OF BRENDAN CARR   
 
Mr. Carr.   Thanks.  Chair Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to testify.  I want to start with the subject of 
today's hearing, the FCC's 2025 budget request.  As I detailed in testimony, I do not 
support the FCC's request for a nearly 15  percent increase in its budget.  This significant 
increase is out of line with agency precedent and out of step with the House's focus on reining in spending.   
More broadly, though, the FCC's request reflects the Biden administration's 
misplaced priorities and a massive regulatory overreach.  
One area where you can see this is the Biden administration's $42 billion internet 
infrastructure plan known as BEAD which puts partisan political goals ahead of smart policy.   
BEAD is the administration's signature plan for extending high speed internet to 
millions of Americans.  And it is a program that is going off the rails.  It has now been 967 days since President Biden signed his $42 billion plan into law.   
967 days later, not one person has been connected to the internet with those 
dollars, not even one shovel worth of dirt has been turned in those 967  days.  And it 
gets worse.  The administration says no construction projects will even start until next year at the earliest.  This makes President Biden's signature $42 billion initiative the This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 slowest moving broadband deployment program in recent history.   
The Biden administration's failure to launch is not only predictable it was 
predicted.  Members of Congress 2  years ago wrote the administration and explained 
that its own decisions would create a complex, nine step, iterative structure review 
process that is likely to mire the program in excessive bureaucracy and delay connecting Americans.  A year later members again explain that the administration's rules divert resources away from bringing broadband service to rural America.   
So what has the Biden administration been doing in those 967  days instead of 
connecting Americans?  It has been layering on red tape in advancing a wish list of progressive policy goals.  The administration is using this program to pursue a climate change agenda, DEI requirements, technology biases, price controls and preferences for 
government -run networks.   
None of this has do with quickly connecting Americans.  And it is not to say that 
there aren't broadband bills underway today with dollars the Biden administration has 
made available, but those other initiatives have their own sets of problems from lack of 
coordination to spending dollars on the penny.   
One example, in 2020 the FCC secured a commitment from Starlink to provide 
high speed internet to over 640,000 locations for about $1,300 per location in Federal support, but the government revoked that award in 2022.  The Biden administration is now spending orders of magnitude more in Federal taxpayer dollars to connect locations 
through its own initiatives.   
The administration's $42 billion BEAD initiative isn't the only instance of regulatory 
overreach that merits this subcommittee's attention.  There are growing set of FCC 
decisions that plainly deviate from the laws that you hear in Congress have passed.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
21 
 The Supreme Court's decision in Loper Bright only underscores the need for the 
FCC to change course in a very fundamental way.  That should start with the FCC 
abandoning its unlawful plan to regulate political speech on the eve of a national election.   
This effort which echoes a DNC -backed initiative at the FEC would impose new 
regulations on AI -generated political speech, just before voters hit the ballot boxes this 
fall.  I oppose it.   
The FCC should also withdraw its decision to vote on a WiFi hotspot order, as well 
as its proposal to regulate bulk billing, which could only raise prices for Americans that live in apartments, condos and public housing.  At bottom, the FCC needs to get back to 
our core mission, closing the digital divide.  That means freeing up spectrum in modernizing our infrastructure rules.  It is time to correct course.   
In closing, I want to thank you again for the opportunity to testify.  I look forward 
your questions.

Mr. Latta.   Thank you very much.  
Mr. Starks, you are recognized for 5  minutes.   
Mr. Starks.   Thank you, Chairman Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, members of 
the subcommittee.  Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you here today.   
One of my highest priorities as a commissioner has been to connect all Americans 
everywhere to high -quality broadband regardless of where they live or how much money 
that they make.  And on this front I cannot overstate the importance of the Affordable 
Connectivity Program for the over 23 American households that relied on this program it 
offered them a critical opportunity to get and stay connected.  
I think about Paul, a senior that I met in Illinois in February, he told me that his 
internet connection was  "like air."  And that is the reality of how vital broadband is to 
Americans today.   
I think about Ron, a veteran who utilized his internet connection to contact the VA 
hospitals to set up medical appointment, more importantly to attend virtual meetings where he said he could share his experience with PTSD to help empower other veterans like himself.   
I think about my visit to Fort Wayne, Indiana and about the families that I heard 
from there who relied on ACP to keep their children from falling behind in school.  I 
remember my friend Debra who asked me if she was going to have to eat less food when 
ACP went away because she would still need the internet.  It was letter link to her family 
and to her church that was otherwise many hours away.  Seniors, veterans, vulnerable families in rural areas, Tribal lands, urban spaces and everything in between, these are the stories of ACP and people that I know.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
23 
 So let me be clear.  ACP is the most effective program we have had in helping 
low-income Americans get online and stay connected.  In fact in my opinion, it's been 
the most successful program ever and our decade's long bipartisan effort to solve the 
digital divide.   
We have made real progress in closing that digital device through ACP and he can 
we cannot afford to let it slide backwards.  And so I look forward to working with those of you on this committee as you reconsider funding this critical program.  Making sure that broadband is affordable is just 1  piece of puzzle.   
We also need to make sure that it was safe and secure so in April we reclassified 
broadband internet access  under Title II of the Communications Act, a service that vitally 
needs oversight.   
I remain concerned as well about the threats to our Nation's networks, but I am 
confident that the FCC's recent bipartisan actions will help protect them.  Just last month the Commission unanimously approved a proposal to require ISPs to adopt 
security risk management plans for their use of border gateway protocol and this will help 
Americans' data and make sure it is securely and accurately routed.  In addition, we must prioritize fully funding our Rip and Replace Program.   
We have made great progress here, but additional funding is absolutely needed to 
complete the removal replacement and destruction of insecure Chinese equipment and services from our communication networks.  Without this funding, providers in rural 
America, including those that support our military installations, are perilously close to 
being shut down.   
While participating in the Rip and Replace Program they cannot update or 
maintain their legacy networks and they need our help.  Network threats including from This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

24 
 state actors like Russia and China are not hypothetical.  America's ability to lead both 
abroad and here at home relies on an extension of the FCC's spectrum action authority.   
And restoring that authority will provide the United States with the strongest 
foundation to compete in a global economy, Tribe growth and investment, enhance competition and ensure national security.   
One of the most visible ways we promote safety and security comes by the FCC 
supporting and improving our emergency alert system today.  We are of course watching Hurricane Beryl storm through Texas and Arkansas.  We have also seen historic 
flooding in the Midwest.  I was in Midwest a few weeks ago and saw flooding in South 
Dakota, saw flooding in Iowa.   
It is essential that Americans receive, understand and act upon an emergency 
immediately.  And that is why we are requiring wireless providers to support alerts in over a dozen languages.  
One of the agency's chief missions is also protecting consumers.  The Cyber Trust 
Mark a great advancement here, as well as the junk fee initiatives that the agency has undertaken.   
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss these and more.  I look forward to your 
questions.

Mr. Latta.   Thank you for your testimony.  
And commissioner Simington you are recognized for 5  minutes for your opening 
statement.  
 
STATEMENT OF NATHAN SIMINGTON   
 
Mr. Simington.   Thank you.  Chairman Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, and 
distinguished members of the subcommittee it is a privilege to appear before you today.   
Today I would like to address what I believe is one of the most pressing priorities 
for the Commission, securing wireless and Internet of Things devices in the face of the 
accelerating move from a single internet and technology market were fragmented along national borders due to concerns about digital sovereignty, specifically threats to the United States from China.  Device security and technology evolution implicates all of the 
commission's core functions at a basic level, most specifically its authority over 
commercial spectrum.   
However, before I highlight these concerns, I must again express my frustration 
with the direction that the Commission has taken in dedicating its limited resources to implementation of partisan unnecessary and burdensome policy frameworks like the Title II broadband and digital discrimination regulatory regimes.  These heavy handed 
priorities leave little room for common sense urgently needed reforms and soak up 
invaluable commission attention.  Such reforms include not only a comprehensive framework for securing our networks with threats which I will address in detail, but also a 
universal service fund contribution's overhaul and it continued focus on space leadership.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
26 
 But now to device security, there was a lot of idealism in the early days of the 
internet.  There was the universal open network where people from around the world 
could exchange services and ideas basically without restrictions.  There were no borders 
online.  If you put up a website in the United States, someone in any other country could access it just a well, perhaps a bit more slowly, but it acts just as well as someone in the United States.  Across the world people were using the same devices, running the same software, usually with no modification and a local translation of the user interface.  But today we have seen that there is potential for foreign technology devices and services to 
be vehicle for espionage and sabotage.  We really cannot be sure that any non trivial 
device from China, be it a network router, a laptop, a cell phone can be trusted to not contain backdoors that would allow the Chinese government to exfiltrate data, take 
control of the device or render it inoperative.  But those same concerns must ultimately extend to any services that store data about Americans in adversary countries or countries and companies that could easily come under the influence of those adversaries.   
Even the most seemingly benign use of foreign technology can become a security 
threat.  GPS developed and controlled by the U.S. military was once the only satellite -based global positioning and precision timing system in the world.  But now it 
faces competition from foreign alternatives like the EU's Galileo, Russia’s Glonass and China's BeiDou.  Supporting those systems there are sometimes a requirement for device manufacturers wishing to sell in those countries.   
So between achieving economies of scale from manufacturers in all markets and 
the fact that these positioning systems currently offer higher precision in some cases than the American GPS system.  It appears that many American businesses and consumers are knowingly or unknowingly relying on these foreign systems.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
27 
 And what is worse, American businesses and consumers often make the decision 
most likely unknowingly to buy untrustworthy equipment from a Chinese or other foreign 
company because the equipment is inexpensive or preselected by a preferred and trusted 
vendor.   
Unfortunately most of these products come from companies that fail to take 
security seriously and that are careless in their software development practices.  How many of these routinely failed to correct known security vulnerabilities in a timely manner and many of don't even take the most basis precautions to prevent unauthorized 
access and control of the now millions of wireless IoT devices they make available to 
American consumers and businesses.   
Given all of these increasingly burgeoning threats, I am very pleased that in March 
of this year my Commission colleagues were willing to reach across the aisle and work diligently alongside me to put teeth into the commission's implementation of the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark program.  This voluntary program sets a high bar for the security of 
wireless devices.   
If manufacturers want to be eligible for the mark, they will have to declare that 
they have taken every reasonable measure to create a secure device.  They will have to 
commit to support period up front.  During that support period they will have to diligently identify critical vulnerabilities in their products and promptly release updates correcting them.  I look forward to continuing to work with colleagues to figure out how 
to expand this program to computers, smartphones, routers and other devices.   
My commission colleagues also agreed to include a further notice of proposed 
rulemaking on the issue of how to handle devices that were software developed in hostile 
countries that will receive updates deployed from or that can be controlled by servers in This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 such countries or that will store user data in those countries.  Such devices at high risk of 
being weaponized by hostile powers like China.  And as a result, there is still so much 
more work to be done to protect the American public.  
Chairman Latta, vice chair Carter, Ranking Member Matsui and members of the 
subcommittee, I want to thank you again for holding this hearing and for the opportunity

Mr. Latta.   Thank you for your testimony.   
Commissioner Gomez, you are recognized for 5  minutes for your opening 
statement.  
 
STATEMENT OF ANNA GOMEZ   
 
Ms. Gomez.   Thank you.  Good morning, Chair Latta, Ranking Member Matsui, 
and members of the subcommittee.  It is an honor to appear before you today.   
In the past 9  months, I have had the privilege of traveling across the country to 
meet with consumers, industry leaders, advocacy groups and local elected officials 
figures.  These meetings highlighted the importance of communication services in daily life and the FCC's mission to ensure these services are accessible to everyone.   
We know that high speed internet service is no longer a luxury but a necessity.  
During a visit to the Orlando Veterans' Affairs Medical Center I learned that 80  percent of 
medical treatments veterans use for recovery required a broadband connection.  A veteran from Paralyzed Veterans of America told me that connectivity is essential for veterans, particularly veterans with disabilities to obtain healthcare, job opportunities and VA benefits.   
The importance of digital connectivity in the daily lives of Americans is what 
makes the funding lapse of the bipartisan Affordable Connectivity Program so concerning.  As of June  1 when funding lapsed, 23 million households across the United States lost 
support for the connectivity they need for work, school and healthcare.   
While some internet service providers have voluntarily stepped up to provide This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 limited free or lower cost service, these are temporary salves.  And absence action 
families will face rising bills and disconnections.  I very much empathize because I have 
lived experience with having to choose between paying rent and paying my phone bill.  
The ACP is e most successful tool Congress has ever provided to close the digital 
divide.  The ACP benefited every corner of the country and it connected communities 
historically on the wrong side of the digital divide.  The end of this program threatens the significant progress.  And I worry that we risk failing to maximize the billions in bipartisan investment in broadband infrastructure.   
Beyond connectivity, I would like to highlight a few noteworthy consumer -focused 
actions that the Commission has taken recently.  We now require that wireless emergency alerts reach consumers in 13 languages and American Sign Language.  This 
will help save lives.   
We also proposed to establish a new emergency alert code dedicated to help find 
missing adults that would not be reported though existing alerts.  This can bring comfort 
to families by helping to find missing loved ones and to address the crisis of missing and 
murdered indigenous persons, a topic I discussed with the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe recently.   
We have also implemented Congress's direction the Safe Connections Act by 
requiring mobile phone providers to separate the line of a domestic abuse survivor from that of their abuser.  And we continue to tax actions to address unwanted robocalls and 
robotexts.  And the Commission reinstated rules to protect the open internet.  
Broadband internet access is too important, too essential to the safety, economy, health, education and well- being of this country not to have guardrails in place.   
From robocalls to spectrum licenses much of our work domestically is tied to our This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 work internationally.  As commissioner I have met with multiple counterparts around 
the world.  From these engagements it is clear that the thirst for wireless innovation is 
global.  With have been global leaders in wireless innovation and made spectrum 
options the gold standard for assigning this finite resource.  We must continue to foster innovation to meet our wireless needs and that requires congressional action to reestablish the FCC's action authority.   
The conversations I have had over the last 9  months have given me a greater 
appreciation for the critical role the Commission plays in the lives of Americans.  I want 
to read you a message I received from a young mother.  I am writing to you as a mother 
of two that really depends on having internet on the ACP to be able to work, to find work and to educate them.  I know it is asking a lot for you to consider keeping this try to find 
funding for it.  I don't have much to my name.   
Everything I have is negative standings right now.  If you can manage to find a 
way or maybe change somebody's mind so that the funding doesn't end.  When I think 
about the mission of FCC, I think about what is at stake for Americans like this young 
mother.  There remains much work to do.  And I am honored to have the opportunity to serve the people of the United States.   
I look forward to collaborating with you, Federal partners, State, local and Tribal 
leaders and all stakeholders as I continue my service.  
Thank you.

Mr. Latta.   And thank you very much for your statement.  That will conclude our 
opening statements from our five commissioners.   
And we will now begin questioning and I recognize myself for 5  minutes.  I would 
like to ask unanimous consent for a point of personal privilege to recognize the former 
chair of full committee, Mr.  Walden.  Good having you back.  We never forget you.  
Commissioner Carr, this Democratic commission has unfortunately voted to once 
again reclassify broadband under Title II.  Chairman Rosenworcel claims that the 
internet did not break when Title II was repealed in 2017 because States stepped in to 
enact their own net neutrality rules.  That broadband coverage has been expanded, it's fees have increased and costs have decreased throughout the United States, not just in the States that enacted net neutrality rules.  What is your response to this claim?   
Mr. Carr.   Well, the presence of those State laws is not the reason why we didn't 
see all of the predictions from 2017 come true.  For one, the State laws didn't take 
effect for a number of years.  For another, if the potential of State regulation was 
enough then that undermines the need for the FCC to step in with heavy handed rules.  The reality is is we yes told that repealing these rules in 2017 would be the end of internet as we know it.  Since then, speeds are up over fivefold, prices are down in real terms, millions of Americans were brought across digital divide and COVID -19 was the 
ultimate stress test with our right regulatory framework or network performed.   
Whereas those in Europe, which had heavier handed utility style regulation saw 
speed slowdowns quite dramatically.  In fact, their regulators asked Netflix and YouTube to degrade the quality of the streams to prevent the continent's networks from breaking.  So this was ultimately a solution in search of a problem that didn't exist.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
33 
 Mr. Latta.   Last meeting that we had, I asked you whether the FCC chair provided 
any briefings to discuss the disclosing the national security threat needed to be addressed 
by Title II.  You said no.  Did you receive any such briefings before the April vote?   
Mr. Carr.   I have had SCIF level briefings.  None of them involved either the FBI 
or the CIA or National Security Agency, just internal officials in the FCC.  There is nothing 
that I have seen in those SCIF level briefings that indicate that Title II was necessary to address any national security threat.  In fact, if you look right now reports are that Commerce Department is using existing authorities, part 7 authorities to look at potential 
issues involving potentially China Mobile, China Telecom if the reports are true.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  
I will continue.  While the FCC is expanding its authority and opposing heavy 
handed regulations in the broadband industry, other Federal agencies are about to 
provide tens of billions of dollars to connect all Americans.  How would a reclassification as Title II service and the FCC's digital discrimination rules effect the success of these 
other Federal programs in our efforts to close the digital divide?   
Mr. Carr.   This regulatory onslaught from Washington is simply increasing the 
cost artificially of American's broadband builders that are trying to bridge the digital 
divide.  It is a headwind, not a tailwind.  How do we know this?  At the very last second in our digital equity proceeding, the Biden administration secured an exemption for its own signature $42 billion BEAD program, which I take as evidence that those heavy 
handed regulations are going to get harder for broadband initiatives to succeed.  
Mr. Latta.   Well, is this the right time to impose these regulations?  
Mr. Carr.   I am sorry?  
Mr. Latta.   Is this the right time to impose these regulations?  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
34 
 Mr. Carr.   Right now broadband builders are seeing a massive spike in their costs, 
everything from supply chain issues to just purchasing pickup trucks to do the actual 
building.  And so right now we need to be focused on eliminating artificial costs, that 
means streamlining permitting which we are not doing, that means pushing more spectrum out there that we are not doing.  That this regulatory onslaught from Washington is only just further increasing costs in an already inflationary environments.  So we are a headwind right to these efforts.  
Mr. Latta.   Well, commissioner Simington, do you agree with that?  
Mr. Simington.   Yes.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.   
I am part of a bipartisan, bicameral universal service working group that is looking 
to reform the USF so the programs and funding reflect our country's needs moving forward.   
Commissioner Carr, what reforms do you think Congress needs to make to the USF 
into the programs it supports?   
Mr. Carr.   Well, thanks chairman for your leadership on this.  You know, when it 
comes to universal service, I am reminded of an old saying from President Reagan that the government oftentimes is like an infant, an insatiable appetite on one end and no sense of responsibility on the other.  Right now the FCC continues to expand our U.S. definition in an unlawful way, in my view including a vote later this month to fund 
hotspots from schools and libraries.   
So the first thing we need to do is stick with the statutory terms and not expand 
the universal service program right now without taking on any responsibility for the fact 
that the cost of this is being born by the monthly bills of Americans, that cost keeps going This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 up and up.  And so I want to commend you for your work.   
Again the FCC should stop expanding it and we should take a hard look at how we 
can put this program on firmer, sounder financial footing.  
Mr. Latta.   Well, thank you.  
My time has expired and I yield back.  The chair recognizes the ranking member 
of the subcommittee the gentlelady from California for 5  minutes for questions.  
Ms. Matsui.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
America's leadership inspection policy fills just enough technological innovation 
and WiFi to satellite and advanced wireless networks.  However, the FCC spectrum 
option lapsed over a year ago.  Undermining America's ability to bring new spectrum to market and advance the spectrum policies in global negotiations.   
Commissioner Gomez, how is the continued lack of spectrum option authority 
impacting our international leadership and the ability of American companies to drive innovation?   
Mr. Gomez.   Thank you for that question, Ranking Member Matsui.  The lack of 
having our spectrum authority is absolutely putting us behind in terms of being able to advance our U.S. competitive as our global competitiveness in wireless innovation.   
For a variety of reasons not the least of which is we cannot currently auction 
spectrum, but we also can't plan for future auctions.  We need that authority in order to be able to take the many steps in advance of an auction in order to be able to initiate an 
auction.  It also effects our innovators and equipment manufacturing because they too 
need certainty to know how they should manufacture equipment, develop equipment based on services that we are going to be auctioning.  
Ms. Matsui.   Thank you.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 We talked about a far right connectivity program, the ACP, many times.  
Chairman Rosenworcel, ACP was a significant resource in addressing disparities and 
broadband access for undersevered communities.  With the program now expired, what 
efforts is the FCC taking to secure the progress made by ACP in closing the digital divide?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Thank you for the question.  The Affordable Connectivity 
Program was the largest program in our Nation's history to help close the digital divide by helping low- income households in every State in this country get online and stay online.   
We are proud of the work we did to get it up and running, now we want to sustain 
all of those opportunities to keep people connected.  Obviously the first thing we can do is have Congress continue to fund this program.  But apart from that we have done a lot of work to reach out to outreach partners to make sure that they are aware of alternatives and that they notify those they have been working with about what it means to stay connected.   
And we are monitoring complaints regarding the Affordable Connectivity Program.  
And I should add that we have seen a 40  percent increase from consumers on them 
because they are upset that this program has come to an end.  So if you can find a way to continue it, I think that is good for us.  
Ms. Matsui.   Thank you very much.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   -- digital divide.  
Ms. Matsui.   As original cosponsor of the Rip and Replace I believe allowing 
Huawei and other vulnerable equipment gear to continue operating in America networks was simple unacceptable.  But that is exactly what is happening today.  We made progress removing much of it, the ongoing funding shortfall means the job is far from over.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 Commissioner Starks did mention the ongoing national security, but what are the 
limitations that rule carriers face when maintaining or upgrading their networks without 
full Rip and Replace funding.  
Mr. Starks.   Yes, thank you for the question and your hard work and leadership 
here.  I have long said network security is national security.  With our providers 
receiving on $0.40 on the dollar, 14 out of 126 applicants have only completed their Rip and Replace work.  
Ms. Matsui.   Okay.  
Mr. Starks.   And so what that really means is that those that are near military 
installations we have vulnerabilities there, some of these are the only providers in rural areas so we absolutely need to finish the job.  
Ms. Matsui.   Okay.  Thank you.   
Robocalls, those are sort of bane of our existence, I think.  But predatory 
robocalls and texts threaten consumer privacy and financial well -being.  In 2022 alone 
the FTC reported more than $1.13 billion in financial losses to consumers from scam phone calls and texts.  That is why I introduced the Stop Scams and Spam Act to expose the worst illegal robocall and robotext campaign and why I introduced the FCC Legal Enforcement Act to further crack down on criminal robo callers.   
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, do you believe that increased transparency and 
enforcement as provided in my bills could help protect Americans from scam calls and 
texts.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yes, I do.  
Ms. Matsui.   Okay, great.  Let me just also ask about this too.  We talked 
about E -Rate many times.  The FCC is at the frontlines of efforts to close the digital This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 divide and programs that E -Rate played a crucial role by ensuring education, equity and 
empowering students with essential resources.   
Chairman Rosenworcel, this month the FCC plans to vote on the proposal to 
support WiFi hotspots for off premises use under the E -Rate program.  How would this 
change impact the digital divide and help close the home ward gap and you have got 
10 seconds.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, you probably remember from the pandemic kids and 
people sitting in parking lots and outside of schools just trying to get online.  This is an 
effort to help stop problems like that.  We have authority under the law to make it 
happen.  Every library should have wireless hotspots alone we should make that the baseline in the United States we should.  
Ms. Matsui.   Thank you very much.  
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady yields back the balance of her time.  And the chair 
now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia's First District for 5  minutes of questions.  
Mr. Carter.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And thank all of you for being here 
today, we appreciate your presence.   
Commissioner Carr, I want to ask you, I understand that the courts upheld the 
FCC's previous rules to streamline the broadband permitting process under Chevron.  Now that the Supreme Court has overturned this decision, how important is it that Congress act to codify those provisions?   
Mr. Carr.   Thank you, Congressman, for your leadership on this.   
I think the legislation that you have been leading on, the American Broadband 
Deployment Act would codify a lot of really smart ideas that would turn things around in this country and make sure that we can start actually building out broadband in a cost This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 effective way.  So I think particularly in light of Chevron, as you know to having Congress 
step in with clear authorization for this can only help.  
Mr. Carter.   Commissioner Simington, would you comment on that as well?  
Mr. Simington.   Yes, absolutely.  The past permitting reform at the FCC greatly 
increased buildout speed.  However, with --  in the post Chevron world, seeing action on 
this from Congress could only benefit closing the digital divide.   
Mr. Carter.   Great.   
Commissioner Carr, does the new digital discrimination regime adopted by the 
commission's majority put the Commission in by extension the trial bar in a position to second guess deployment decisions made by broadband providers?   
Mr. Carr.   Yeah, this provision was a one -page provision of law tucked into a 
1,000 page bill.  And the way the FCC read it, it was as if it conveyed more authorities in the entire 1934 communications act and every single statute or provision passed since then.  No was limit under the FCC's reading to authority now, whether it is Wall Street or 
Madison avenue or construction crews or even governments itself are now subject to 
second guessing by the FCC here in Washington.  
Mr. Carter.   So essentially how would the need to defend against these 
challenges likely decrease investment in risk taking by broadband providers?   
Mr. Carr.   We now have unlimited liability  based on the --  
Mr. Carter.   Exactly.  
Mr. Carr.   -- equity rule.  If you take an action, you, may be liable.  If you don't 
take an action, because it covers omissions as well, you might be liable.  And so it gives no certainty to capital allocators that need to put and that we should want billions of dollars to go into our networks.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
40 
 Mr. Carter.   Let me ask you about Loper Bright and the Supreme Court's decision 
there.  Does that effect FCC's recent digital discrimination rules?   
Mr. Carr.   I think the digital equity rules and the Title II rules in my view were 
always going to be subject to major questions doctrine not Chevron.  But fundamentally 
Chevron reinforces the idea that the Framers want you here in Congress to mike these decisions rather than having the FCC or other agencies take a provision of law that doesn't address an issue or only does so in an ambiguous way and claims expansive authority.   
So I think the Supreme Court's decision reinforces the constitutional structure of 
the people's representatives here making these fundamental decisions about what the Federal law should be.  
Mr. Carter.   What about you, commissioner Simington?   
Mr. Simington.   Well, on the merits I don't know how I would comply with the 
digital discrimination rules if I were in the position of having to make those decisions in 
business.  And I also don't know how we are going to enforce them.  It doesn't seem 
that there are any real standards as commissioner Carr said, anything that you do or fail to do maybe attributed against you.  
Mr. Carter.   Exactly.  
Mr. Simington.   So I agree with his analysis that this would likely come under 
major questions doctrine and not Chevron.  Nonetheless, I also agree with his statement 
about how the Supreme Court has allocated the balance of responsibilities.  
Mr. Carter.   Okay.  Commissioner Carr, disparate impact, that does not appear 
in section 6506 of the IIJA.  Given the complete absence of that and the complete 
absence of the explicit direction by Congress to employ such a standard in rules to This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 prevent digital discrimination, do you believe the Commission has erred in adopting such 
a standard in its new rules?  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 RPTR DETLOFF

[11:00 a.m.]  
Mr. Carr.   It did.  The FCC created a record to look for instances of 
discrimination in the broadband market, and after 2 years, the FCC said its record 
indicated that there were no such instances of discrimination.   
Nonetheless, the FCC adopted the strong medicine of this disparate impact 
theory, which means, even if you have no intent to discriminate, the courts can come in 
and second -guess it.  What the courts have said is if Congress is going to create a 
disparate impact theory of liability, it has to use very clear specific words, again, because 
it is very strong medicine.  Those words were absent from the statute.   
Mr. Carter.   Commissioner Simington, do you have anything to add to that?   
Mr. Simington.   Just that, again, the reach of this also needs to be emphasized.  
Commissioner Carr mentioned that it reaches construction companies.  It reaches 
anyone who in some way limits access even if involuntarily or unknowingly.  So that is a 
very broad brush.   
Mr. Carter.   Great.  Well, obviously, this committee and this Congress have got 
a lot of work to do to help you guys.  So thank you very much for being here.  Again, I appreciate it.   
And I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman yields back the balance of his time.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from California's 29th District for 5 
minutes for questions.   
Mr. Cardenas.   Thank you very much, Chairman Latta and also Ranking Member This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 Matsui, for holding this important hearing.   
And I really appreciate the commissioners being here.  I appreciate the 
information that you are sharing with us, and I certainly agree and disagree with many of 
your opinions, but here we are.  I would love to discuss a few issues with you.   
I would like to start with the obvious off the top in that it is a travesty that my 
Republican colleagues have allowed the funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program to lapse.  The ACP was a vital lifeline for millions of Americans and tens of thousands of families in my district who would otherwise struggle to get connected and stay connected 
to the internet, a basic necessity in today's world.   
Allowing funding for this program to expire is negligent on the part of our 
Republican leadership, and I would like to once again urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to work with us to get the ACP up and running again.  All of us here on 
both sides of the aisle have constituents who benefited from this program.  This should be a no -brainer for all of us to work together on.   
I would like to start with my questions with the FCC's adoption of its $200 million 
School Cybersecurity Initiative last month, which I am happy to see that action.   
As you all know, it was widely reported that L.A. Unified School District, one of the 
largest in the country, suffered a massive cybersecurity attack in 2022 that compromised the records of thousands of students, including data on COVID test results, driver's licenses, and other personal information.  Improved cybersecurity for our students is 
critical in investing in and one that hits close to home not only with my community but 
communities across the country are at risk.  
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, what are the Commission's goals for this program, and 
what would success look like?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
44 
 Ms. Rosenworcel.   Thank you so much.   
As you know, cyber attacks are reaching school districts across the country, big 
districts like in Los Angeles and small ones like St. Landry Parish in Louisiana.  And 
restoring the networks for learning can take anywhere from 3 days to 3 months.   
So we took a look at the E -rate program, which has long supported broadband to 
our Nation's schools, and we decided that we would start a pilot program to try to understand this problem and then also understand what partners exist in the solution, and by that I mean the Department of Education, our colleagues at the Cybersecurity 
Infrastructure Security Agency, and also State and local officials.   
Mr. Cardenas.   Thank you very much.   
I would also like to thank the Commission for its efforts to require georouting 
solutions for wireless calls to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.  We have made great 
strides in improving our response to members of our communities who are experiencing a mental health crisis through the 988 Lifeline.  However, there is always progress to be 
made.   
Currently, when you call 988, you are routed to a call center based on your area 
code, as it should be.  If I were to call 988 from Washington, D.C., I would be connected 
with someone based in L.A. because that is where my phone is from.  This is a problem when a call center needs to send a mental health response team to help a caller that may be thousands of miles away.  The FCC's 998 georouting proposal would help solve this 
problem.   
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, can you talk about the Commission's 988 georouting 
proposal and the importance of the FCC's efforts to better connect Americans 
experiencing mental health crisis with location -specific resources?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
45 
 Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  988 has been around, this month, for 2 years, and in 
that time, 10 million people have reached out in crisis from all across the country to get 
help.  It is a success story, but we can make it better.  And the way we make it better is 
making sure that when someone reaches out for help, they get help from someone nearby.  And what we are doing with georouting is just that.  We are going to --  instead 
of using the area code, we would use the cell tower that is picking up the call to route to a crisis center.   
We have sent letters to carriers, we have done some testing, and we started a 
rulemaking to make sure we have technical standards.  Now, once we complete that rulemaking, we will need the Department of Health and Human Services to work with us to put it in the contract, but I believe all of that is possible this year.   
Mr. Cardenas.   Thank you very much.   
Commissioner Starks, can you provide your perspective and how Congress can 
support your work on this issue?   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  On 988, again, this is folks who are calling in a critical part of 
their life, need help, need it to be done close to where they are.  As we have heard, working with HHS, working with industry, it has been a real collective effort here as well as some of the resiliency and making sure that we have the right requirements in place.  It has been a real team effort.   
Mr. Cardenas.   Thank you very much.   
988 has yet to become as common around the country as 911, but it is moving 
forward fluidly and as it should, and I really appreciate the efforts that the FCC has done.  This is lifesaving work, and that is critical, and I think that is one of the main reasons why we all run for office, to make sure that our Americans are safe in every situation with This is an unedited transcript.

 every possibility.   
My time has expired.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Utah for 5 minutes for questions.   
Mr. Curtis.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, the Commission has decided to allow speed test 
submissions as a valid way to challenge claims of mobile service.  However, the FCC will 
not allow consumers to submit speed test data to verify claims of fixed service.   
Can you explain why the Commission would not allow a speed test as a valid 
individual challenge to the fixed broadband map?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  This is a good question and one we are working 
through, but I want to correct one or two things you have said.   
Mr. Curtis.   Sure.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Okay.  With respect to fixed challenges, we do accept speed 
tests for availability data to prove that services present are not present.   
With respect to the actual speeds, it is more complicated, because where you 
place your router in your house has a huge impact on your speeds.  We are looking for a statistical way to validate this so that we can use that data more comprehensively going forward.  I would be happy to make sure your office is kept updated.  
Mr. Curtis.   Thank you.  Yes, I would appreciate that.   
Also, I would like to talk about mapping.  The FCC's National Broadband Map acts 
as the base layer of coordination for important broadband funding programs, including the BEAD.  Ensuring that these maps are accurate and up to date will ensure that funds are not wasted and the digital divide is closed quickly and effectively.  Part of that This is an unedited transcript.

 process is challenging the serviceability broadband location.   
Can you explain how the Commission works with CostQuest to review challenge 
data and why demonstratable on -the-ground proof of service might be rejected as a valid 
bulk challenge to the underlying Fabric data?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   All right.  It is a complex process we set up.  We did it 
pursuant to the Broadband DATA Act, which is legislation from this committee.  And 
what you said about this map and its data being our accountability program for all these broadband spending dollars, I just want to agree with you.  That is spot on.   
So it is imperative we get it right, and when we get it right, that occurs when we 
take updates from our vendor, CostQuest, which helps manage our Fabric and also updates from carriers, consumers, and local and State authorities.  We try to combine all that information and crowdsource it and get the best map possible.  It is an iterative process.  We take all that data in and update it every 6 months.  And I would be happy to provide more information about just how we do that if you would like.  
Mr. Curtis.   Okay.  And with the BEAD program set to improve most, if not all, 
of State proposals by the end of July, the FCC's National Broadband Map, NBM, is a critical component in making those funding decisions.   
As FCC continues to update and refine the NBM, how does the FCC plan to address 
providers who overstate their coverage?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, first, providers that overstate their coverage in a willful, 
malicious, and dishonest way, we send them to enforcement and take action against them.  There are incidental overstatements, and we rely on State officials, authorities, and customers to correct them.   
But in addition to our process of assessing where service is and is not, I know that This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
48 
 the BEAD program requires every State to run its own process.  And that is important 
too, because I really believe local and State officials have a better command of what is 
going on in their backyard, and that has got to inform where they spend those dollars.  
Mr. Curtis.   Thank you.   
Also, Commissioner Carr, if you would also weigh in on this.   
In May, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to strengthen 
requirements and oversight of Telecommunications Certified Bodies, TCBs.  I think this is 
an important action to strengthen our national security.  Can you discuss how the threat 
posed by TCBs with no ties to our adversaries?   
Mr. Carr.   Yeah.  Thank you, Congressman, for the question, and thanks for your 
leadership on all these national security issues.   
This one is interesting.  So, over the years, Congress has passed laws that have 
asked the FCC to stop insecure network gear from getting into our networks.  This 
proposal builds on that, because the idea here is let's make sure that the labs and other 
certification bodies that are checking for this equipment are themselves trustworthy 
actors.   
I really want to thank the chair in particular and her team for the work to move 
that forward to a proposal.  I look forward to trying to get that to an order soon.  I think it will be another piece of our overall national security strategy.  
Mr. Curtis.   Chairwoman, would you like to comment as well?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   It is really important that we update our Telecommunications 
Certification Bodies and the labs that give them data, and I have been working with Commissioner Carr on this.  I agree with everything he just said.  
Mr. Curtis.   Thank you.  Thank you for your succinct answers.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 Chairman, I yield my time.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman yields back the balance of his time.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Michigan's Sixth District for 5 
minutes for questions.   
Mrs. Dingell.   Thank you, Mr. Chair.   
And thanks again to everybody for joining us today.   
I do want to say, as I said in my opening statement, we really do need to fund the 
Affordable Connectivity Program.  There is no question about it.  Many people in my 
State have talked about it.   
In Michigan, nearly 1 million households  -- one in four households in the State of 
Michigan have saved money on their internet bills because of the ACP.  We needed to 
act yesterday.  It is crucial for ensuring that all Americans are able to participate in the digital economy, access education and healthcare resources, and stay connected to essential services.  I just urge all of my colleagues to work with us to get this program 
funded.  And as I said in opening remarks, I have had people crying because they can't 
afford it.  It is bad.   
I am working on legislation to address the threat of domestic abusers exploiting 
connectivity tools in vehicles to harass and intimidate their partners.  This effort would establish a process for survivors to request determination or the disabling of connected 
vehicle services that abusers could misuse, ensuring their safety and confidentiality 
without imposing additional burdens on them.  This would also allow survivors to 
maintain access to a vehicle, which is a crucial tool for achieving safety and independence.   
We have to take proactive measures to address the vulnerabilities in connected This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
50 
 vehicles.  Ensuring that modern vehicle communications contribute to the safety of 
domestic abuser survivors is essential.   
Madam Chair, in April, the Commission issued a Further Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking to support survivors of domestic abuse and sexual violence.  Could you provide an update on the Commission's progress?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Thank you for that.   
I think you know right now cars are like smartphones on wheels.  They are very 
sophisticated.  
Mrs. Dingell.   Which most people don't know.  Yeah.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   They are very sophisticated.  They can track where we go 
and what we do.  And there have been press reports that they have been weaponized for victims of domestic violence.   
We can fix this.  It is within our power.  Congress already directed us with the 
Safe Connections Act to make survivors of domestic violence have more secure 
communications.  We have got to apply similar policies to our vehicles.   
So I appreciate what you are working on.  I will make sure that what we do at the 
FCC we coordinate with you so that we can work in lockstep to solve this problem.  
Mrs. Dingell.   I really want to do that.  And we will be introducing bipartisan 
legislation on this because, by allowing individuals to disable or terminate access to 
connective vehicle services that abusers could exploit, we are going to protect them.  
That is just pure and simple dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and sex trafficking.   
Let me move to robocalls.  As I brought up in previous hearings in front of this 
committee, we know that bad actors can take advantage of our vulnerable populations 
through robocalls and robotexts.  Often driven by artificial intelligence, scammers can This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
51 
 exploit vulnerable consumers by using tactics to deceive them.  While AI has the power 
to make it easier for consumers to give information they are looking for, unfortunately, it 
is also used to trick them.   
I appreciate the work all the Commission is doing on combating robocalls and 
robotexts, holding these scammers accountable.   
Again, Madam Chair, what do you most need from Congress to help the FCC stay 
ahead of the scammers?  Would more resources for consumer education help?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   The answer is yes, but I have got a few things that I think 
would be really, really helpful.  The first is this:  It was about a year and a half ago that 
the Supreme Court issued an opinion that narrowed the definition of "auto dialer" under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  It took huge swaths of these calls out from our oversight.  It means we get more junk that is now not accountable.  I would like to rework with you on the definition of "auto dialer", update it so that we can go after more of these bad actors.   
We also in the last year and a half issued $650 million of fines.  That is a lot.  
But every one of those fines I have to turn over to my colleagues at the Department of Justice, and it takes a really long time for them to go enforce them against those scam artists.  I would like to have the authority to do it ourself.   
And, separately, I would like access to data from the Bank Secrecy Act.  
Increasingly, we are identifying that these scam artists are so sophisticated, they will set 
up a company, we find them and shut them down, and they set up something else 
somewhere else using the same bank accounts.  The more that we have access to their financial information, the more we will be able to shut down large enterprises responsible for this junk.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
52 
 Mrs. Dingell.   Thank you.   
I don't have a lot of time left, but would any of the other commissioners like to 
add to that?   
Mr. Carr.   Thank you, Congresswoman, for your leadership on this.   
One issue that came to mind when we were talking about the connectivity in 
vehicles that I have been starting to focus a bit more on is -- particularly as we see this 
rush of vehicles coming in from China  -- when you look at the capacity of connectivity and 
the surveillance capacity and the information that we pulled in, I think that is something 
that merits attention because, again, we are looking at everything from drones to 
applications to devices themselves.  I think we need to continue to scrutinize this issue as well.   
Mrs. Dingell.   I am out of time, so I will yield back, Mr. Chair, and submit some 
more questions for the record.  Thanks to all of you.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you very much.  The gentlelady's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan's Fifth District for 5 
minutes for questions.   
Mr. Walberg.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
And thanks to the witnesses for being here today.  I appreciate you taking this 
time.   
With the recent Supreme Court Chevron deference decision and the scrutiny of 
the administrative enforcement powers and discretion, do you have  -- Commissioner 
Carr, do you have concerns with the FCC's enforcement process which often lacks due process protections that would require additional congressional action, and if so, how would you reform the FCC's processes?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
53 
 Mr. Carr.   I think there is a number of Supreme Court cases recently that really 
require the FCC to think about correcting course.  One of them is a Supreme Court case 
called Jarkesy, which has to do with administrative agencies and enforcement.  I think 
the FCC should start a proceeding to take a look at our existing enforcement mechanisms to make sure that they align with the constitutional parameters outlined by the Supreme Court.  Otherwise, we could be taking enforcement actions that end up getting overturned in court.  So I think we need to take a refresh on our enforcement procedures right now.   
Mr. Walberg.   Thank you.   
Chair Rosenworcel, again, my condolences as well with my colleagues.   
Recently, New York's broadband law was allowed to go into effect, mandating that 
all fixed broadband providers offer qualifying low -income customers a $15 or $20 service 
at specified speeds.  In past hearings, you have told me you opposed rate regulation.  In fact, no asterisks.  I will never forget that.  And in your recent order, reclassifying 
broadband under Title II, you specifically forbeared from rate regulation of any kind.   
So, Madam Chair, does your order preempt States from engaging in rate 
regulation of broadband, and do you support the New York law?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, first things first, we said no rate regulation as a result of 
our Title II reclassification.  I have repeatedly said to you I don't support that either ex 
post or ex ante, and apparently I said no asterisks as well.   
Mr. Walberg.   Right.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   That being said, what you are talking about is a State law that 
a court let go into effect.  There is no petition before us, but we did say in our order that State broadband affordability efforts do not per se violate our rules.  We will look at any This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
54 
 individual cases if a petition is filed before us, and one is not before us right now.   
Mr. Walberg.   Commissioner Carr, would you like to comment on that?   
Mr. Carr.   The FCC's Title II decision, regardless of what your view as a policy 
matter is on that, plainly preempts New York State law.  It is true that the FCC said that 
if a program is labeled as a State broadband affordability, it is not necessarily preempted, but you have to look at the substance.  And the substance of the New York law is naked rate regulation, and we should step up and be clear that we don't support rate regulation and that that provision of New York law is preempted by operation of the agency's Title II 
decision.   
Mr. Walberg.   Well, I would hope you would hammer that out as a commission 
because, frankly, with impunity going against what has been put in place by Federal 
standard ought to concern us all.   
Commissioner Carr, both of us have been long -time champions for boosting our 
telecommunications workforce.  You have climbed towers.  I have offered to climb 
towers, but nobody wants an old guy to go up, I guess.  So we need young people out 
there.  I still hear from providers all the time about their workforce struggles as they try to connect people across my district.   
Do you have an update on what the telecommunications workforce looks like now 
and what more can be done, if anything?   
Mr. Carr.   Thanks for the question.  I very much look forward to getting up a 
tower with you.  I think that would be a lot of fun.  I am happy to come to your district for that.   
Look, there is billions of dollars, as we have talked about  -- even putting BEAD to 
the side --  that are going to be rolling out to connect communities, and we are barreling This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 towards a workforce shortage.  Again, the 42 billion BEAD dollars haven't hit the ground 
yet, but when they do, that is going to put a real strain on workforce challenges.  And so 
we need to be getting ahead of that now.   
We have been looking to community college programs to stand these up, but we 
need to sort of move a little faster on that effort.   
Mr. Walberg.   Okay.  Well, we can all join arms together on that because, 
frankly, this is now and this is the future.  We can't get behind.   
So, Mr. Chair, I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman yields back.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from California's 16th District for 5 
minutes for questions.   
Ms. Eshoo.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman and our Ranking Member Matsui, for 
holding this important oversight hearing.   
To the chairwoman  -- distinguished chairwoman, thank you, and welcome.  And 
to each commissioner, it is good to see you all.   
This may be the last time I participate in an FCC oversight hearing, and I want to 
thank the Commission for the work that you are doing, the work that has been done.   
This is my 32nd year as a Member of the House of Representatives, the great 
privilege of my life, and 30 years as a member of this subcommittee.  So while previous 
commissioners and chairmen are not in the chamber, I still want to salute them for their 
work.   
I am not going to go through all of the marvelous things that the FCC is doing and 
has done  -- this FCC Commission.  The chairwoman did that magnificently.  We should 
all take pride in that.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 They are not only proposals but policies that have been put in place, number one, 
for our national security.  When we take our oath of office to protect and defend, that is 
you as well as us.  That is our number one priority.  And I am proud that the 
Commission finally paid attention, under your leadership, Madam Chairwoman.  I knocked down the door for a long time to raise the specter of what the Chinese Government was not only capable of doing but was already doing.  So I salute you for that.   
Commissioner Carr, I want to say a few things to you.  It is obvious that I don't 
agree with you on just about everything you said today.  You know, there is an old saying that there are those who know the price of everything but ignore the cost for those who are affected.   
I ran for Congress to lift people up, to improve the lives of the American people.  
And the more American people that are lifted up to share in the dream of this country, the better off we all are.  The better off we all are.  To disparage the BEAD program 
and other undertakings of the Commission that really look after the working stiffs in this 
country I think is just dead wrong.  When we push people down, we are hurting ourselves.   
I think that Commissioner Gomez' testimony of who she has met, who has written 
to her, is one of the great --  they are great voices of this country.   
So I regret that -- you know, I mean, it was said this morning by the chairwoman of 
the full committee really berating the Commission, and yet every single Republican of this subcommittee and full committee voted against expanding broadband in our country.   
When I say I served here, I have served on this subcommittee for 30 years.  For 
over 20 of those years, Republicans and Democrats were wringing their hands to not only This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 have a map but that we invest in it.  And then when it came time for that to be the 
dream come true for our country, no.  Is that hypocrisy?  I don't know what it is.  The 
one thing I know what it is is that I think it is very wrong.  Very wrong.   
Our country is made up of extraordinary ordinary people.  Extraordinary ordinary 
people.  And when our policies stray from that, we stray away from the core of what this 
democracy is all about.   
So I hope that --  let me just give Chairwoman Rosenworcel a moment to accuse 
the -- Commissioner Carr accused the FCC of unjustly revoking a contract with Starlink to 
provide broadband to over 600,000 homes.  Do you want to address that?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  First, you have been a formidable voice on this 
committee, and I am grateful for the role model you have made, making clear that women can speak up without apology.   
With respect to what you were speaking about earlier, the last administration 
made distribution decisions under our rural universal service program 2 weeks before an 
election.  I inherited those decisions.  We did a full financial and technical review of 
every preliminary winning bidder.  We found about a dozen of them did not meet financial or technical marks.   
Mr. Latta.   If the gentlelady could finish up.  The gentlelady's time has expired.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Just 1 second.  One of them was a satellite service because 
they couldn't consistently meet upload and download down -link speeds.   
In addition, the company you are mentioning had 6,500 census blocks --   
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady's time has expired.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   -- that were already served  --

 Ms. Rosenworcel.   -- or traffic medians or airports or downtown Chicago.  
Mr. Latta.   Your question can be taken to a QFR.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   We asked them to take the service out.  They refused.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.   
Ms. Eshoo.   Thank you.  I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania's 13th 
District for 5 minutes of questions.   
Mr. Joyce.   Thank you, Chairman Latta and Ranking Member Matsui, for holding 
this oversight hearing.   
I also appreciate the chairman and all the commissioners for taking time to testify 
today.   
Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, as I have emphasized to you in the 
past, is incredibly rural.  It has hills and hollers, nooks and crannies, surrounded by 
mountains.   
I appreciate the efforts that the FCC has taken so far to focus on connecting all 
Americans, specifically the constituents of Pennsylvania 13.  With that comes the responsibility to manage large amounts of grants and Federal funding.  This funding is going out to providers not only in my district but over the entirety of this great land.   
Chair Rosenworcel, last week, the FCC announced that it will not provide 
broadband relief for RDOF and CAF II providers that default on their build -out obligations.  
I applaud that decision.  Providers should be required to fulfill their obligation to the American people.  This issue raises an important consideration about the coordination between the FCC and NTIA as the BEAD program is rolled out.   
How are the two agencies coordinating to ensure that there is not overbuilding of This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
59 
 RDOF and CAF build -out locations within the BEAD program?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Thank you, Congressman.   
This is a really important question.  We have so many broadband programs, we 
need to make sure we take those resources and use them in a smart way.   
We have got two initiatives at the FCC that speak to your question.  First, in the 
last month, I signed, again, a memorandum of understanding with the Department of 
Treasury, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Commerce, to make sure that we coordinate on all data with our broadband programs.   
Second, I am producing something called the Broadband Funding Map, and it 
doesn't get enough attention.  It is a map of all of the enforceable commitments under our broadband programs in the United States.  We can use that map for accountability to make sure there is no overbuilding and that we make sure we reach everyone.  That map is really important, and I encourage every member of this committee to become familiar with it.  
Mr. Joyce.   Thank you.  And I appreciate you bringing that into this discussion.   
This rollout is going to be the largest investment of a decade, and might be the 
best chance that we get to connect rural Americans.  It is our responsibility to use this opportunity to ensure that my constituents are able to connect to reliable and high- speed 
internet.   
The 5G Fund is another important funding source that enables rural connectivity.  
It is imperative that the 5G Fund is distributed efficiently and results in actual 5G wireless services being provided to rural areas.  This program is intended to replace portions of current High Cost Fund, and millions of rural communities risk losing connectivity if it is not implemented correctly.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
60 
 Commissioner Carr, as written, the 5G Fund uses a minimum of 7/1 speeds.  
Previous FCC programs require speed thresholds with higher minimums, reflecting 
services that consumers want and have come to expect, and 7/1 is clearly low for 5G 
standards.   
Are you concerned that lowering the bar on the speed thresholds would degrade 
the intent of the fund?   
Mr. Carr.   Thank you, Congressman, for the leadership, and thanks for your work 
in your district.  I have enjoyed the chance to spend some time there with you in a 
broadband roundtable that you organized.   
With the 5G Fund, I voted previously to move forward with it.  I have called for 
this agency to do it.  I think the most important question right now is, how do we do so 
in a way that makes sense with the BEAD program that is underway as well so we can align the two programs in a way that makes sense from a timing and other perspective?   
But you are right, we should be funding services at the end of the day with the 5G 
Fund that are capable of offering 5G services.  
Mr. Joyce.   Chair Rosenworcel, can it truly be called a 5G Fund if the technical 
parameters in the current order will not reliably provide 5G services?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   All right.  I want to just acknowledge where we are right 
now.   
We have a draft that I have put before my colleagues.  We are talking about the 
draft, including service levels, what is viable in different parts of the country, what technologies are going to be used to make sure that we get to everyone.  So we are not done with this process yet, and I will make sure that our conversations take what you just said into account.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
61 
 Mr. Joyce.   Thank you.  We would appreciate that, and if you could make this 
committee aware as you proceed with that.   
Congress must ensure that we are providing Federal grants to communities where 
they are needed.  All of us need to be responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollar and 
providing funds to rural areas  -- not just large urban centers  -- where the connectivity will 
be life -changing and, in some cases, truly life -sustaining.   
I thank all of you for being with us here today and for giving your time, and I yield 
the balance of my time.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman yields back.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois' Second District for 5 minutes 
for questions.   
Ms. Kelly.   Thank you, Chair Latta and Ranking Member Matsui, for holding this 
important hearing this morning.   
And I also want to thank the witnesses -- commissioners for their testimony.   
I know that closing the digital divide in these communities cannot be 
accomplished without bold, innovative solutions, and that is why I have been supportive of the Affordable Connectivity Program, or ACP, which helps eligible low -income 
households afford the broadband they needed.  The success of this program is undeniable, as nearly 23 million Americans have been enrolled in the program.   
Similarly, with over 2,000 farms in my district, I am keenly aware of the need to 
expand broadband connectivity in rural and agricultural areas, to ensure farmers can take advantage of the benefits of precision agriculture.   
Commissioner Starks, can you share how the FCC is working to bring connectivity 
to our country's agricultural areas, and what role do you see fixed wireless technology This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
62 
 playing in helping connect rural America?   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  Thank you so much for the question.   
I attended the Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois, many years ago, and so I 
might have met some of the farmers that are in your district there and heard directly 
from them what they need for their farms for precision agriculture, what they need to keep family members who --  and their way of life.   
And so, so much of what we are doing  -- I think the 5G Mobility Fund will make a 
play on how we are going to help get agricultural better connected.  Obviously, the 
RDOF that we have discussed here today also has a real play.  But as you pinpointed as 
well, I think fixed wireless is going to absolutely -- has grown exponentially.  I have seen 
it as my time as a commissioner, and will continue to play a large role.  
Ms. Kelly.   Thank you very much.   
Shifting gears to the FCC's upcoming July open Commission meeting where it was 
recently announced that the agency would consider the implementation of Martha 
Wright -Reed Act  -- of the Martha Wright- Reed Act and how to adopt just and reasonable 
rate caps for incarcerated people's audio and video communication services.   
Delivering these reforms and ultimately providing relief to incarcerated persons 
and their families is critical, especially as there have been reports that hundreds of county 
jails around the U.S. have eliminated in -person visits, making often pricey video calls the 
only visual connection between detainees and their family.   
Chairwoman, I am encouraged to see the FCC will be considering rules to 
implement the bipartisan Martha Wright -Reed Act at the agency's July open meeting.  
To level set, can you explain the importance of this act championed in the House by my friend, Representative Bobby Rush, and how incarcerated people, their families, and all of This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
63 
 our communities benefit from these rules?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  It was almost 2 years ago that a grandmother, Martha 
Wright, wrote us and complained that she was paying absolutely usurious amounts to 
stay in touch with her grandson who was incarcerated.  And when the agency looked into it, we found that for a single call lots of families were paying more than you and I pay for our monthly unlimited plans.  That is not right.  And it doesn't just harm families of the incarcerated; it harms all of us because regular contact with family and kin reduces recidivism.   
Now, for years, we have tried to fix this problem.  We have gone back and forth 
with the courts.  But, finally, former Congressman Rush, along with Senator Duckworth -- there is a lot of Illinois here --  came forward and said here is some authority 
to help you fix that problem.  And this month, I am proud to report that I expect our agency to do just that.   
Ms. Kelly.   Thank you so much.   
I am committed to ensuring that incarcerated people can communicate with their 
loved ones without having to worry about unfair, exorbitant fees, so please know that my staff plans to follow up with you all to learn more about the agency's work in this space.   
Lastly, I want to know that there has been quite a lot of discussion recently about 
the FCC starting a proceeding to consider banning or otherwise limiting bulk billing arrangements in multi- premises environments.  From the comments I have received 
from my district, such an effort could raise concerns.   
They tell me both deals help keep prices low and give them higher -performance 
broadband, and ending these deals could eliminate these benefits.  But I also understand that there are many variations of what these arrangements could look like, This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 and in some cases they may be driving consumer frustration.   
I recognize the FCC has yet to adopt the proposal and seek comment on it, so I will 
continue to monitor the FCC's efforts on this issue and the comments the agency receives 
to ensure the agency is putting consumers' interests first.   
With that, I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady yields back the balance of her time.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida's 12th District for 5 minutes 
for questions.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate it very much.   
To follow up with Ms. Kelly, you can see this is a bipartisan issue.   
Chair Rosenworcel, you recently announced an NPRM that would prevent bulk 
billing arrangements between the broadband providers and housing communities.  Since that announcement, I have received letters from 140 constituents unanimously in opposition to the proposal, fearing it would significantly increase costs.  So I am glad 
that Ms. Kelly brought this up as well.  It is a great concern for our seniors.   
The vast majority of these messages come from those residing, again, in senior 
living communities on fixed incomes.  Particularly now with the inflation being so very 
high, it is so very difficult for our seniors.   
An FCC report and order in 2010 aligns with these constituent concerns stating, 
and I quote, It would be a disservice to the public interest if, in order to benefit a few 
residents, we prohibited bulk billing, because so doing would result in higher MVPD 
service charges for the vast majority of multi- dwellings unit residents who are content 
with such arrangements.   
And I have a letter from Timber Pines.  Timber Pines is an adult This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

65 
 community -- senior community in my district in Spring Hill, Florida.  Many letters from 
Timber Pines.   
How is it in the public interest, Commissioner Chair, to directly cause increased 
rates for a significant number of Americans under this proposal?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  I think we can all agree that broadband is an essential 
service, and we also have policies in place that prevent there from being exclusives in 
apartment buildings that lock up an apartment building so that folks can't get any other provider and benefit from competition.   
One-third of the people in this country live in apartment buildings or multiunit 
dwellings.  That is a lot of people.  But what we are finding now is they are bypassing those exclusive prohibitions and just baking it into the rent or assessment fees on each apartment and unit.   
And so what I have received as the chair of the agency are a lot of complaints from 
consumers who say, everyone else gets competition; why don't I get competition?  Why 
do I have to pay for this service if I don't want to use it?   
So what we have proposed is a rulemaking to ask those questions, mindful that 
there are some constituents, including folks like the ones you described, who might like 
these services.  But it has been 14 years since we looked at this issue, and 14 years in broadband is a long time.  We want everyone to have the benefit of competition.  So opening this issue up for public comment I think is the right thing to do.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Well, keep in mind, again, you know, these seniors are in fixed 
incomes.  It is a big concern.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I promise you that we will do that as we proceed.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Please.  Please.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
66 
 Commissioner Carr, what is your take on this proposal?   
Mr. Carr.   I think the FCC should withdraw this proposal.  I think it could only 
raise the prices for Americans living in these types of buildings.   
And I think when you think about competition, the building or premises owner 
have a lot of market power, and, in fact, they are competing in a market for services that 
is very robust.  So if you were to prohibit bulk billing, you would be going from a really frothy competitive environment and force people to get broadband services in a relatively less competitive environment.   
So it is bad for competition, and it is bad for prices.  I don't think right now is the 
time when we should be saddling Americans with that.  The FCC has looked at this issue multiple times over the years and found that they do more good than harm, and I think we should stick with that.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Thank you.  Thank you, sir.   
I still have a couple more minutes.  Not a couple, but quite a few seconds.   
Commissioner Carr, we are constantly trying to ensure our international 
leadership in various industries, including the wireless marketplace.  What effect will the FCC's Title II order have on American leadership in wireless technology?   
Mr. Carr.   Well, I think it is a headwind, right.  It only makes it harder to build 
out and invest.  And more broadly, I think if you look at this administration, it has fallen into a real deep malaise when it comes to one of these most important considerations for 
economic growth, which is wireless.   
Right now, we have no plan to turn things around.  Even though we do have a 
lapsed general spectrum auction authority, we do have authority still to auction 
spectrum.  In fact, just last week, the FCC missed a statutory deadline to auction 30 This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
67 
 megahertz of spectrum because the Commerce Department, in 2022, failed to meet a 
2015 era statutory deadline imposed by Congress for identifying that specific 30 
megahertz.   
So not only do we not have auction authority, but the administration isn't taking 
the steps that would let us move forward with auctions even where we do still have 
authority.   
Mr. Bilirakis.   Thank you very much.   
And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate it.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from New York's Ninth District for 5 
minutes for questions.   
Ms. Clarke.   Let me thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank our ranking 
member.   
I thank our commissioners for appearing before us today.  Let me thank you for 
all of your hard work and your dedication.   
And under the leadership of Chairwoman Rosenworcel, this commission has done 
critical work to protect consumers and our communications networks, promote innovation, and ensure access to high- speed affordable internet connectivity.  It is a 
reality for all Americans.   
Due to the work of the Democrats on this committee, the FCC, until recently, 
responsible for administering one of the most successful programs in bridging the digital divide, the Affordable Connectivity Program, and now awaiting some movement to get this program back in place.   
As I have noted at countless hearings over the last year, the undeniable success of This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 the ACP brought affordable high- speed broadband across to more than 23 million 
households.  Unfortunately, House Republican leadership has blocked my bipartisan, 
bicameral legislation to save the ACP from receiving consideration on the floor of the 
House, and funding for the ACP lapsed over a month ago, leaving millions of households forced to choose between paying for broadband or other essentials like food and medication.   
Despite the continued Republican blockade of critical funding to the ACP, I remain 
hopeful that we can come together in a bipartisan manner to save this critical program 
and to close the digital divide once and for all.   
My first question this morning is on the mechanics of the potential restart of the 
Affordable Connectivity Program.  One concern with allowing ACP funding to lapse even 
temporarily has been the potential cost of reenrollment.   
It is essential that we do not lose the sense of urgency regarding ACP funding.  If 
we allow the ACP to remain inactive for more than a few months, we must keep in mind the enormous strain the increased cost of service is having on families and remember 
that any attempt to restart or refresh the program after a long pause would require a significant undertaking to reengage skeptical households that previously relied on the ACP before the lapse in funding.   
So, Chair Rosenworcel, with the lapse in ACP funding, are we still within the 
window of time where restarting the ACP program would not require significant 
investment in reenrollment of subscribers, and if so, how much time do we have left?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yes.  Well, thank you for your leadership on this issue, and 
like you, I am an optimist we can get this done.  We have systems still in place at our 
administrator.  We still know every benefit -qualifying individual that signed up for this This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 program, and we have got hundreds of outreach partners across the country who are 
ready to go if Congress finds a way to continue this program.   
I will keep you posted before we turn any of those systems off.  Again, I am still 
hopeful that Congress will be able to refund this program because it has been so consequential when it comes to ending the digital divide.  
Ms. Clarke.   Likewise.  And thank you so much, Chairwoman.   
In addition to equitable access to broadband services, one of my top priorities for 
years has been increasing the diversity and independence of the media marketplace.  To 
that end, I was very pleased to see the Commission's May announcement of the NPRM on 
fostering independent and diverse sources of video programming.   
The inclusion of unreasonable Alternative Distribution Methods, ADM, and the 
most -favored -Nation provisions in carriage agreements can prove significant obstacles for 
independent programmers seeking carriage -run both Multichannel Video Programming 
Distributors, or MVPDs, and online platforms.  And while innovations in the marketplace 
have given consumers multiple ways to consume video content, carriage on MVPDs 
remain critical for networks of all sizes, especially emerging media companies.   
So, Chairwoman, what is the FCC doing or what can it do to ensure independent 
programmers can equitably compete for carriage, and how do you see the marketplace for independent programmers on MVPDs and online video distribution platforms evolving?   
And Commissioner Starks and Gomez are welcome to offer your thoughts as well.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   The ways we watch are changing.  Every one of us now can 
bring up what we want when we want it on any piece of glass handy, and yet there are old problems that persist on traditional channel lineups.  New voices, independent This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 programmers can't always get a fair shot.  We hear that over and over again.   
So 2 months ago, we started a new rulemaking on this to get an updated record to 
understand what the problem looks like in this new media environment.  We can keep 
you posted as the record develops.   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  The only thing I would add --  
Mr. Latta.   Pardon me.  About 10 seconds because the gentlelady's time has 
expired.   
Mr. Starks.   Yes, sir.   
The only thing I would add, in the media space, the last time we looked at this was 
2016.  Anytime you are talking about such a long gap, it is worthwhile for us to have a refresh.   
Ms. Clarke.   Very well.   
And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.   
But I just wanted to ask this.  Commissioner Gomez, if you have comments, 
would you send them to us in writing because my time has elapsed.   
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you very much.  The gentlelady's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia's 12th for 5 minutes for 
questions.   
Mr. Allen.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for convening this hearing of the fiscal year 
2025 Federal Communications Commission agency budget.   
And I want to thank the commissioners for being here today.   
I would like to start by recognizing the Commission for their unanimous adoption 
of the declaratory ruling in February which recognized that calls made with AI -generated This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 voices are artificial under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  So thank you for 
that.   
Yesterday, I introduced my Creating Legal and Ethical AI Recording Voices, or 
CLEAR Voices Act.  This bill would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to establish technical and procedural standards for artificial or prerecorded voice systems created through generative artificial intelligence.   
Consistently, some of the biggest concerns I hear from constituents are regarding 
the robocalls, scam calls, and texts.  With the increasing use of AI in communication, 
maintaining public trust is crucial, and the CLEAR Voices Act takes great strides in doing 
that.   
Chair Rosenworcel, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to prohibit 
all early termination fees imposed by cable and direct broadcast service providers.  Even President Biden's statement in connection with his junk fees executive order proposed addressing ETFs only to the extent that they are unjust or unreasonable, which 
appropriately recognizes the contractual nature of the ETFs and the benefits customers 
receive when opting for term contracts.   
Would it not be more appropriate for the FCC to instead address only unjust or 
unreasonable ETF practices, such as failure to fully disclose them, and not just implement an outright ban?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   So we have an open proceeding on this.  We haven't made a 
decision yet.  We have lots of consumers who complain about early termination fees.  They signed up for a contract, but then they got saddled with some big lump sum they had to pay when they want to get out of it.  We are trying to understand what the scope of what is reasonable is there.  That is why we have an open proceeding on this subject.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.

 I appreciate what you said.  We will make sure we take it into consideration.   
Mr. Allen.   Okay.  The draft NPRM does not explain how an outright ban of ETFs 
would be reasonable given the cost savings and other consumer benefits available 
through term contracts with ETFs and given the month- to-month service options also 
available to consumers.   
How do you justify removing customers' options to choose to get a discount in 
exchange for agreeing to take service for a specified time period?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, that is why we are having a rulemaking.  We are asking 
to try to identify what is reasonable under the context.  That is the purpose of having a rulemaking.  That is the purpose of asking the public, and I hope we can shape the definition of "reasonable" as part of that effort.   
Mr. Allen.   Commissioner Carr, the chairwoman has announced plans to move 
forward the 5G Fund.  While I support closing the digital divide that exists in rural America, I am worried that adding the 5G Fund on top of the Rural Digital Opportunity 
Fund, the BEAD fund, the Capital Projects Fund, and the ReConnect Program will lead to 
wasted funding instead of connectivity.   
Do you see this overwhelming amount of broadband dollars as a reason for 
concern as the FCC considers the rules for the 5G Fund?   
Mr. Carr.   Thanks, Congressman, for the question.   
I supported before moving forward with the 5G Fund, but you are right, there has 
been sort of a sea change in the amount of Federal support that is out there since then.  Not just the $42 billion of BEAD, but by my count, we have made over $800 billion available that could be used for infrastructure, including broadband infrastructure.   
So as we proceed with the 5G Fund, we have to be so very mindful of all these This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
73 
 other programs and how do we make sure we move forward in a smart, coordinated way, 
and those are still issues that I think need to be worked out.   
Mr. Allen.   Wouldn't it be wise to wait till the BEAD funding is at least partially 
deployed so that 5G Fund is available to fill in the gaps instead of duplicate funding?   
Mr. Carr.   That is one of the arguments that we are looking at very closely, is how 
do you align this with BEAD.  There is the argument that if you wait until after BEAD, you could potentially have the 5G Fund go further.  Others argue that they want to move forward sooner in order to take advantage of the connectivity that would be enabled, and 
that sort of wrestling of those issues is what we are sort of looking at right now.   
Mr. Allen.   Chair Rosenworcel, with the NTIA BEAD funding program set to 
approve most, if not all, State proposals by the end of July, the FCC's National Broadband 
Map is a critical component in making those decisions.   
As the FCC continues to update and refine the NBM, how does the FCC plan to 
address providers who overstate coverage?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   If you willfully or maliciously overstate your coverage, we will 
send you to our Enforcement Bureau, and we will take action.  We have already done so.   
We are also using all available processes to make sure that that data is accurate, 
including challenges from State, local authorities, other carriers, and consumers.  And we welcome any information that you have from your office, and we can incorporate that 
into our mapping efforts too.   
Mr. Allen.   Thank you.   
My time is up.  I yield back.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentleman's time has expired.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 And the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from New Hampshire's Second 
District for 5 minutes for questions.   
Ms. Kuster.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
I want to start by thanking all of the commissioners for being with us today.   
It is clear the agency has gotten straight to work, from the implementation of the 
Safe Connections Act, which I helped pass, to protect survivors of domestic violence, to its 
work fighting robocalls and protecting Americans from harmful scams.   
The FCC also administers, we have discussed today, the Affordable Connectivity 
Program, making broadband more affordable for 22 million American households, including nearly 40,000 in my district in New Hampshire.  But my Republican colleagues continue to refuse to fund this program, leading to millions of Americans losing access to affordable broadband that they rely upon.   
As chairwoman of the New Democrat Coalition, I led multiple letters with our 
Members to House and Senate leadership urging them to put politics aside and fund the 
ACP.  I will continue fighting to fund the ACP.   
In the 21st century, access to reliable, affordable internet is not a luxury.  It is a 
necessity, including, I might add, for our own defense.  When we are talking about 
recruitment and we are falling short of our recruitment goals, how the hell would 
somebody sign up to serve in our military if they did not have access to the internet?   
From connecting job seekers to employers, to accessing telehealth services and 
education, the ACP has helped millions of hardworking Americans stay connected.   
As a founder and co -chair of the Bipartisan Mental Health and Substance Use 
Disorder Task Force, I am committed to ensuring that individuals in crisis can access the help they need when they need it.  The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is an important This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
75 
 first step in these efforts, but while this lifeline may help to connect callers to resources, 
these resources aren't guaranteed to be local.   
Currently, if someone calls 988 from the State of New Hampshire, their 603 phone 
number, their call will be routed to local crisis centers in New Hampshire, even if they find themselves far from the Granite State and in need of local assistance.   
Commissioner Starks, can you speak to how the FCC is working to address this 
issue and what more needs to be done?   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  Thank you so much for the question.  Thank you for your 
leadership and hard work on this critical issue.   
It has been just about 2 years now that 988 has been up and running, and we 
continue to build on that tremendous success.  Nearly 10 million calls that we have had.  We continue to make sure that folks that are dealing with this life crisis have a place that they can call.   
And so, to your point, making sure that they can interact with a local counselor is 
something that we have heard from mental health advocates, and that is where we are pushing for our policymaking to go.   
The last thing that I would say is just it has been such a cooperative effort 
between industry, mental health, HHS, SAMHSA.  Everybody here has been working so hard together for the American people that are in crisis this way.   
Ms. Kuster.   And do you think there is some kind of option where they could say 
where their location is and it wouldn't just be driven by the area code?  Is that something being sorted out?   
Mr. Starks.   It would not be driven by the area code.  It would be based upon --  
Ms. Kuster.   GPS or --   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
76 
 Mr. Starks.   -- where the cell phone is pinging off of.  
Ms. Kuster.   Okay.  Great.  That is very helpful.  Thank you so much, and we 
look forward to working with you.   
Chairwoman Rosenworcel, as Congress works to restore the FCC's spectrum 
auction authority, can you explain what role the FCC plays in setting technical rules for 
particular spectrum bands, and are there specific factors that Congress should keep in mind?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I think our record on this is extraordinary.  We are the first 
country in the world to auction off airwaves.  We are the first country in the world to hold incentive auctions.  We are the first country in the world to have creative dynamic sharing systems to allow for hierarchies of spectrum rights.  We are the first country in the world to take garbage unused spectrum and turn it into unlicensed airwaves which are used for WiFi.  In other words, the record of the United States and the FCC to take airwaves and put them to market is second to none.   
The challenge we face going forward is there are more things we are connecting 
wirelessly -- more people, more places, more things  -- and the reality is we are going to 
need more spectrum to continue to fuel that.   
So what we will need from Congress is renewing that spectrum authority, and we 
will need some details on which bands you think we should approach next and convert perhaps from Federal use to new commercial use.   
Ms. Kuster.   Great.  Very helpful.  Thank you.   
I will just close by saying, broadband is an essential service in today's digital world, 
and I appreciate all of the work that you all are doing to make it more accessible and affordable for our constituents.  Thank you so much.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 RPTR DEAN  
EDTR ZAMORA  
[12:00 p.m.]  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady yields back.  
And the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Tennessee's First District for 
5 minutes for questions.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you witnesses for being 
here today.   
You know, the First District of Tennessee is home to a large amount of Federal 
land, specifically the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Cherokee National 
Forest.  And updating wireless internet infrastructure on Federal lands is currently bogged down in the red tape of NEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act.  And I can tell you firsthand, some of the most difficult places in my district to get quality service is going to be the Great Smoky Mountains and the Cherokee National Forest.  And that 
is just hurting our communities.   
In February, I introduced the Wireless Broadband Competition and Efficient 
Deployment Act, which would roll back the red tape, keeping these communities on 
Federal lands from getting the infrastructure to stay connected.   
And my question is for you, Commissioner Carr.  How important is it for Congress 
to take an active role in turning down these barriers to broadband deployment like 
overburdensome and sometimes ridiculous permitting requirements?   
Mr. Carr.   Thanks, Congresswoman, for your leadership, particularly on Federal 
lands, where it simply takes too long and costs too much to build out.  I was just on 
another national park myself last week, Shenandoah.  And I had virtually no cell phone This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
79 
 service.  In fact, I had to climb this small little tower to get any service at all.  I ended 
up climbing that mountain a lot, fairly addicted to the internet.  And so I think we need 
to move forward with legislation and leadership that you are showing and generally 
taking a look at permitting reform.   
Look, we have been spending a lot of money, $800 billion, again by my count; $42 
billion if you look at BEAD.  But we are not streamlining permitting.  That is just like stepping on the gas and the brakes at the same time.  We have got to get serious about the types of reforms that you have been leading on.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  
Let me follow up with another question for you, Commissioner Carr.  There is 
general acceptance of the security risk posed by reliance on China to power U.S. communications.  Are you at all concerned that these Chinese -made communication 
chips may create vulnerabilities or security concerns for the U.S.?   
Mr. Carr.   Yeah.  Look, I think when you look at the CCP, they aren't just simply 
coming at us through one vector, even one technology vector.  It is a 1,000 different things that they are doing to try to prod and exploit vulnerabilities.  We have taken action on the device layer, Huawei, ZTE, at the carrier level, China Mobile, but there is more to do, including data centers as well.   
Your point about chips is exactly right, and I think that can help feed into our 
proposal to look at labs and certification bodies that are going to be reviewing the 
components to make sure that those labs are themselves trustworthy.  But we need to 
sort of play defense across all of these different areas of technology, because we are getting prodded by the CCP across all of them.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   You don't have to tell me anything.  That is nothing new.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
80 
 So I guess another question, you can answer it, Commissioner Carr.  What 
methodologies can the FCC or other Federal agencies deploy to ensure that broadband 
programs are making accessible connected devices that are verified and can be trusted?  
It leads into what you just said.  
Mr. Carr.   One thing that we can do is complete our proceeding that is looking at 
these TCBs in labs.  I think another step that I have called for is for the FCC to look at the entities we do regulate and prohibit them from interconnecting with insecure entities, including China Mobile and China Telecom, to the extent that they are not even offering 
necessarily Title I or Title II services.  I think that is one thing that the FCC should be 
doing.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   Yeah, no joke.  
In the past year, the FCC has adopted rules governing broadband labels, digital 
discrimination, net neutrality, and data breaches.  And you are considering more rules in these areas and in other areas, like outage reporting.   
So my question is, can a company with 20, 30, 50 employees really keep up with 
all of this without significant burdens to that company?  We want them to survive, but how can they do that?   
Mr. Carr.   I think what people lose sight of is that the broadband builders in this 
country that are truly bridging the digital divide in rural communities, it is not these large corporate behemoths.  In many cases, it is mom -and-pop operations, small 20 -person 
operations, and they are confronting a regulatory onslaught from Washington.  We need to sort of decrease that regulation and that will help unleash their ability to build.   
Look, they are already dealing with inflation, they are already dealing with high 
fuel prices.  And on top of that we are raising the regulatory cost.  Again, BEAD I think This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
81 
 is a perfect example where the Biden administration is layering on all of these regulatory 
costs that Congress specifically either prohibited them from doing or didn't authorize 
them to do.  And price controls is a piece of that.   
Right now, the administration is holding up applications from Tennessee and from 
other States.  We just got a letter from Tennessee saying that the Biden administration 
is compelling them to engage in price controls and rate regulation as a condition to getting the money that they are owed through BEAD.  That is just unnecessarily slowing things down in addition to being bad policy.  
Mrs. Harshbarger.   So you agree, decrease the permitting regulations and just 
regulations in general.  Okay, I agree.   
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas' 33rd District for 5  minutes of 
questions.  
Mr. Veasey.   Thank you, Chairman Latta.   
And I want to thank the commissioners for being here again.  It probably will not 
come as a surprise to some of the commissioners on the panel that I want to talk with you today about ACP and about the fact that ACP has lowered internet bills for 23 million American families, which I think is great, because I represent a district in the Dallas -Fort 
Worth area that is largely lower income.  And I also think that it is great too for my 
Republican colleagues, because the data shows that in rural areas that they represent, 
that even more people have signed up for ACP.  And so I think that it has been a win -win 
for people all around the country.   
And we all know that the expiration of the ACP is an issue that is really going to This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
82 
 hurt these 23 million families, and I am very concerned about that.  Also concerned 
about the fact that Republican leadership hasn't advanced any legislation whatsoever for 
their rural constituents or the constituents that I represent to make sure that this lifeline 
doesn't expire.  And as a result, funding ran out in June, and prices have gone up for nearly about 70,000 people in the district that I represent just in the Dallas -Fort Worth 
area.  So imagine, again, how that impacts people from all around the country.   
And so I have a question for Chairwoman Rosenworcel.  Has the FCC heard 
directly from impacted consumers that are having to navigate this new post -ACP world?  
I was wondering if you could kind of weigh in on that.  And Commissioner Starks and Gomez are also welcome to join in.  Thank you.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah, we have heard from lots and lots of consumers.  We 
have seen a 40  percent increase in the number of complaints about billing and charges 
related to ACP.  These are people who are angry, upset, and bewildered by the fact this program has come to an end.  They are from rural America, urban America, and 
everything in between.  A disproportionate number of them are elderly, single parents, 
and retired military.  And we have got heartbreaking emails that come to my inbox every day.   
And I know that Commissioner Starks and Commissioner Gomez spoke eloquently 
about this in their statements, so I would love it if they would continue the discussion.  
Mr. Starks.   Yes, thank you.  Agree with all that.  You know, the numbers 
simply show that one in six households in America are enrolled.  That is a big number.  That is impacting a lot of folks.   
One thing that I would like to highlight for you, Congressman.  One of the 
initiatives that I had was Your Home, Your Internet, making sure that those that were in This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
83 
 Federal housing assistance, HUD housing, Section 8 housing, that they knew about the 
program, they automatically were qualified.  When I started that initiative, about 
500,000 eligible households were enrolled.  After the momentum that the FCC gained 
on it, nearly 2 million at the time of the freeze were enrolled.  So it is a real number of folks that started to know about the program, see what it could benefit for them for telehealth, telemedicine, for young learners.  And So I wanted to highlight that in the work that we have done coordinating with HUD, which is extraordinarily important.  
Ms. Gomez.   Thank you, Congressman.  And by the way, thank you for the call 
as well.  I enjoyed speaking with you very much.  
I absolutely agree with everything that the chairwoman and Commissioner Starks 
have said.  We are hearing from consumers, heartbreaking emails that we get from them just about every day.   
In addition, when we go visit localities, we hear from parents who are extremely 
worried about how they are going to afford connectivity for their children.  We hear 
from seniors who are relying on the ACP in order to maintain connections.  And we hear 
from the veterans.  This is both urban and rural areas nationwide, so it is a significant problem.   
And as I mentioned earlier, I have lived with not having the resources to pay my 
bills and having to make the difficult decision between paying for food or paying for a phone bill.  And this was before connectivity became so crucial to our daily lives.  So 
this is a significant issue, and thank you for your leadership.  
Mr. Veasey.   Yeah.  No, absolutely.  And I also wanted to ask you all, if 
Congress is able to fund the ACP before the end of July, can the program be restarted 
using possible bridge funding of $7 billion to $8 billion?  And do you think it also makes This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
84 
 sense to include ACP in an update to the USF?   
Ms. Gomez.   Thank you for that question.   
First of all, I very much encourage the efforts on updating the USF.  We want to 
make sure that it is sustainable.  And putting ACP as part of the USF funding would make 
it sustainable as well and then we wouldn't have to have these conversations every few months.  
Mr. Veasey.   Yeah.  
Ms. Gomez.   To answer your first question, bridge funding would certainly be 
helpful.  And if Congress passed it by the end of July, I would probably come here and do cartwheels.  
Mr. Veasey.   Thank you very much.   
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
Mr. Latta.   Well, thank you very much.  The gentleman yields back.  
And the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Iowa for 5  minutes for 
questions.  
Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   Thank you, Chair Latta and Ranking Member Matsui, for 
holding this hearing today.  And I want to also thank the witnesses for testifying before this committee.   
I am hearing some very harsh language from the other side of the aisle; perhaps if 
we prioritized our spending we wouldn't be worried about whether or not we get the 
money.  But all I know is rampant $1.9 trillion COVID spending at the beginning of this 
Biden -Harris administration led to rampant inflation, which has led to 20  percent cost 
increases and has led to record high interest rates which are really challenging everybody.  And having grown up in a very humble family, having to decide whether or not I could This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
85 
 afford food or something else very necessary, I know those challenges.   
Commission Carr, in your testimony, you stated that the BEAD initiative is the 
slowest moving Federal broadband deployment program in recent history.  Specifically, 
$42 billion program, 967  days since it was signed into law, not one person, home, or 
business has been connected to the internet with these dollars.  No construction projects will even start, according to the President, until 2025 and many in 2026.   
Can you explain how the Biden -Harris administration's decision to add additional 
red tape is causing unnecessary delays and jeopardizing the program?   
Mr. Carr.   Thank you for the question.   
I will start with your point about ACP and spending.  Look, the FCC did its own 
survey, and it found that, of this $17 billion, only 15  percent of people said that they 
would lose internet service if the program expired.  So I think as people in Congress focus on ACP, let's focus on the 15  percent, or whatever number really needs it, rather 
than simply pouring more money into that existing program in its current form.  
With respect to BEAD, $42 billion and a promise to connect millions of Americans, 
and 967  days later not even a shovel worth of dirt has been turned.  Some people have 
said we should measure that program by its intention to connect millions of Americans.  I think we should measure it based on its results, and right now, it is off the rails.  We are looking at DEI requirements, climate change requirements, price controls.  Right now, the Biden administration is going back and forth with Virginia that wants the money 
to move forward, saying, you didn't put enough of a thumb on the scale for a price 
control, please rewrite it this way.  The same thing with Tennessee.   
So rather than staying laser- focused on just getting Americans across the digital 
divide, we are wasting time on things that have nothing to do with connecting them.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
86 
 Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   Do you think the program will be a success, more 
importantly?  And then, how do we define success?  To me, it should be defined by the 
number of households, the number of businesses that have been connected.  
Mr. Carr.   I think BEAD is a program that is worth fighting for, but it needs a 
course correction.  We can still do it.  Let's stop trying to pursue DEI and just bridge the 
digital divide.  Let's stop pushing these climate change agendas and just connect communities.  If we can do those things and get rid of the extraneous political improvising, I think this program will get closer to getting back on track.  
Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   Commissioner Simington, you indicated in your testimony 
that the Universal Service Fund is in urgent need of reform.  How would you reform the USF both in terms of distribution and contributions?   
Mr. Simington.   Absolutely.  So the Universal Service Fund, of course, dates 
back to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, at a time when the landline market was a lot bigger than it is now.  Thus, on the front end of contributions, it is very difficult to 
fund a growing program out of a shrinking base.   
Now, if you look at what the landline network was supposed to do, universal 
service says it was supposed to connect all Americans in a single network.  In fact, it was 
to be a network that was intercompatible with all the networks worldwide and, thus, it benefited from the network effects of scale.  Today, the beneficiaries of the networks effects of scale are online companies primarily.  So to put it another way, when Comcast 
gains a customer, it is not just Comcast; it is Google, it is Meta, it is Amazon.  These are 
the companies that benefit even more from universal connectivity than individual network operators who do not have the same advantages of scale.  
Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   How would you change that?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
87 
 Mr. Simington.   Well, I think by contribution reform, we would say that the main 
beneficiaries of these network effects should be considered as contributors.  
Mrs. Miller- Meeks.   Thank you.   
And lastly, more of a comment, because I think this question has been asked and 
answered, but in agricultural heavy States like Iowa, the advancement of precision 
agriculture is essential for our farmers to remain competitive and efficient.  Widespread and ubiquitous either broadband or wireless coverage.  And I have been in the combine with farmers who are using  -- or use Starlink.  I have visited with our manufacturers as 
well.  It is really important for the adoption and importation of precision agriculture technologies, which would meet some of those sustainability goals that you are trying to implement.  And I would just encourage the FCC to expand and enhance wireless availability, as was mentioned earlier, to meet the growing demands, but also to ensure that the BEAD program is put in place and enacted, and let the providers get to do the work that they do because they are extraordinarily frustrated in my State.   
And then, a question for the record.  Chairman Rosenworcel, answer a question 
for the record, we would just like to ask what the FCC's role is in spectrum studies that NTIA is leading.   
With that, I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady yields back.   
The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida's Ninth District for 5  minutes 
for questions.  
Mr. Soto.   Thank you, Chairman.   
We live in a time of incredible technological advances:  autonomous vehicles, 
artificial intelligence, e -commerce, telehealth, online education.  All these things are This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 going through our committee as we speak, and all require high -speed internet; 
connections that we need to make sure every American has to flourish.   
On the $42 billion fund for high- speed internet, as well as the $14.2  billion 
Affordable Connectivity Program, both are part of making this access available to 
everyone, especially in rural areas.  I have both urban, suburban, and rural in our district.  And the FCC, you all stand at the vanguard of this progress.  The only complaints I hear back home from local folks is it is not happening fast enough and that the Affordable Connectivity Program ran out.  
Commissioner Gomez, thank you so much for coming to the district, to the 
Orlando VA, and speaking with local veterans, including many disabled, wounded warriors.  And as you mentioned, 80  percent of medical treatments our veterans are 
undertaking require broadband connection.  And ACP has provided benefits to 79,000 households in my district and has reduced cost by $37 million.   
And so can you expand on the importance you think the ACP program plays, 
especially in healthcare and for our veterans?   
Ms. Gomez.   Thank you, Congressman, for that question.  And thank you again 
for the visit in Orlando at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  It was really interesting, and I really appreciated hearing directly from beneficiaries of the Affordable Connectivity Program.  
As you mentioned, 80  percent of healthcare from that medical center requires a 
connection to broadband.  And we heard from so many folks during that visit about the importance of connectivity and the ways that it actually saves costs for these very veterans, particularly veterans with disabilities.  If they need to go to a hearing in order  -- for their benefits, before they had broadband connectivity, they would have to This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

89 
 get in the car or a van, drive for hours, get a hotel room for at least a couple of days, in 
order just to be able to attend the hearing.  Now they can do it online, and that saves 
them costs, it saves the government costs.  So that is just one example of the things that 
we heard when we were visiting with the VA center.  
Mr. Soto.   Thank you.  
Commissioner  Starks, as you may know, I filed the Launch Communications Act 
again.  It has passed the House again.  We appreciate the Commission's important work on the issue of ensuring greater spectrum for launches.  We had 73 last year, we 
will have over 100 this year, and the weather doesn't always cooperate.  So really 
important that we continue streamlining this process.   
Can you please discuss the need to expand the amount of spectrum that is 
available for commercial space launches and reentries and the importance of streamlining the process for accessing spectrum for this use?   
Mr. Starks.   Yes.  It has been -- thank you for your longstanding work here.  It 
has been extremely important.   
We are seeing more launches than ever.  We need to keep pace with the 
technology, keep pace with innovation.  And we have been able to with the Space Bureau here, now be able to move quicker, be able to be more nimble.  And it has been more important than ever as we are getting more and more connectivity and more of what satellite is going to look like.  
Mr. Soto.   Chair Rosenworcel, first of all, I am sorry for your loss, and welcome 
back to the committee.  I am excited about the competition we are seeing in the satellite market.  We are launching so many of the Starlink satellites, and Kuiper Belt is about to come up as well, to expand both satellite internet as well and from low Earth This is an unedited transcript.

 orbit.   
What can the Congress do to make sure the United States continues to lead in 
building a competitive and dynamic space marketplace?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Well, thank you.  I know that Kennedy Space Center and 
Cape Canaveral are in your backyard.  And I had the privilege of going there last year 
and meeting with the Artemis 2 astronauts.  And it really is an out of this world experience what is happening.   
We have had, nationally, more than 200 space launches in the last year.  It is no 
longer occasional.  We have built the biggest commercial space industry in the world.  And to the extent that this is a budget hearing, let me be clear, we need more resources for our Space Bureau.  You want us to process this faster and make sure we continue to lead the world?  That is part of the ways to do it.   
I mean, we have got tens of thousands of satellite applications sitting before us 
right now.  Everything we can do to get more engineers, economists, and policy experts 
to review that, be thoughtful about it, and engage with our global counterparts is 
valuable and it is valuable for our geopolitical leadership.  
Mr. Soto.   And I second that, Madam Chairwoman.  
I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   The gentleman's time has expired.   
And the chair now recognizes the gentleman from Idaho's First District for 5 
minutes of questions.  
Mr. Fulcher.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
Mr. Carr, I paid particular attention to your comments just a few minutes ago 
regarding the importance in the beneficial aspects of speeding up the process of approval This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 across Federal lands with NEPA, National Historic Preservation Act.  And I actually have 
legislation that would do that, and that is in the works.  So, hopefully, that will make 
some headway with that.   
But in a previous conversation, you had talked about a Federal Lands Desk, if I 
recall correctly, and the possibility of a conduit there that might speed things up.  And 
so this was not part of my original line of questioning, but is there anything further  -- it 
has been a while since this conversation has taken place  -- is there anything 
further  -- further developments on this, on the Federal Lands Desk, or is this something 
that we need to take further steps for here?   
Mr. Carr.   I think we need to continue to move forward.  There are a lot of 
infrastructure ideas that we can do.  For instance, we streamlined a lot of rules at the FCC that apply to small cells, just one type of technology.  We need to extend those to more technologies, and the Federal Lands Desk I think would help as well, because Congress has taken a lot of stabs at streamlining the permitting process for Federal lands, 
but a lot of these agencies, like Forest and otherwise, they have important day jobs as 
well and they just don't get around to this quickly enough.   
So I think if we had a place at the FCC where folks could come and help dislodge 
some of those applications, I think it could be helpful.   
Mr. Fulcher.   So it is particularly pertinent to my State.  We have got two -thirds 
of land mass, approximately, where that is an issue.   
I have also heard about backlogs as a concern, specifically within BLM for service.  
Are you hearing anything like that that might be slowing down the process or the channels?   
Mr. Carr.   We hear about this constantly.  I visited places all across the West This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
92 
 where you will go to a laydown yard, an outdoor warehouse, and they will have, you 
know, multiple antennas sitting there, many, many miles of conduit sitting there.  So the 
hard part of, like, getting all that equipment out there and purchasing it is done, they are 
not just sitting there waiting on approvals from the government to get out there and build it.  And I think that is a real big problem.   
The further West you go, the higher percentage of Federal lands.  If you pick a 
spot to build and it just happens to be Federal lands, it can take you two times longer than if that plot of land happened to be privately owned.  We have got to close that gap.  
Mr. Fulcher.   Appreciate that.   
Commissioner Rosenworcel, do you want to comment on that?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  I just want to acknowledge this is a good point.  
Across the country, about one -third of our land is owned by Federal authorities.  It is the 
least built out land when it comes to communications.  And I believe it was in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act that Congress required the GSA to set up a 
uniform form for all of our Federal agencies when a provider wants to approach them 
because they want some construction.  I think that form is called Form 299.   
But the deadlines on that form are long.  They can take 270  days to respond.  
Just to be clear, the FCC's deadlines for States and localities are 90  days and 150  days.  I 
think we should expect a faster response time from our Federal authorities, and I would encourage you to you look into the status of Form 299.  
Mr. Fulcher.   Appreciate that.  Appreciate that very much.  Thank you.  
I would like to shift gears just a little bit.  This has been touched on as well, but I 
hear feedback on it.  I want to ask Commissioner Carr if he can expound on this a little bit.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
93 
 This is regarding the effect of the Title II proposal, and the impacts on small and 
rural providers.  We have a lot of those in my State, but I am hearing the possibility of 
price controls.  That is a concern in the industry.  And the potential impact on these 
smaller and rural providers, I want to get your feedback on that.  Is that a real concern?  And what should we be doing about this?   
Mr. Carr.   Thanks.  I think price controls as a policy matter is the absolute wrong 
direction, because we need to be attracting billions of dollars across the country into these networks.  And there is a risk out there.  The FCC in its Digital Equity Order opens 
the door to rate regulations at the Federal level, even though it disavows it in the 
separate Title II decision.  But you are seeing a number of States, New York being an example, that are trying to impose price controls on their own.   
Similarly, you see the Commerce Department, the Biden administration pressuring 
States  -- Virginia is one example, Tennessee is another -- to adopt price controls, even 
though the law that you pass here in Congress told Commerce Department no rate 
regulations.  So there certainly is this latent and growing effort to impose it, and it is a 
policy and legal mistake as well.  
Mr. Fulcher.   Thank you for that.  
Chairman Rosenworcel, this has got to be really quick, and I can follow up with a 
written question as well.  But can you speak very quickly to the possibility of improving the process of adding entities to the FCC's covered list?   
Mr. Latta.   And again, the gentleman's time has expired.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  The authority was given by Congress to other 
agencies.  I can follow up with you on that.  I would happy to work with you to  --  
Mr. Fulcher.   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I yield back.  This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
94 
 Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The time of the gentleman has expired.  
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from the Seventh District in Texas for 5 
minutes of questions.  
Mrs. Fletcher.   Thank you so much, Chairman Latta, and thank you, Ranking 
Member Matsui, for convening today's hearing.   
And thank you to our commissioners for being here to testify about the FCC and 
the many important issues under its jurisdiction.   
And as many of you, I think probably everyone here has seen, Hurricane Beryl hit 
the Texas Gulf Coast yesterday with my hometown of Houston right in the path of the 
storm, when this Category 1 hurricane made landfall yesterday and made it right through Houston and our area.  As of last night, there were 2.2  million people without power, 
including at my own home.  
And I know that our folks on the ground are working as hard and as quickly as 
possible to restore power and to restore communications.  And I have spoken with a lot 
of our local communications providers who have established backup power sources to 
make sure that my constituents don't lose their ability to be in contact with emergency responders, with family, with friends, and to try to make sure that they can get through the storm during this emergency.   
So, Chairwoman Rosenworcel, I really want to thank you and thank all of your 
colleagues for the Mandatory Disaster Response Initiative, MDRI.  And for those who 
don't know, these are new rules that took effect in May  -- just in May  -- that wireless 
providers take certain actions to improve and reduce the impact of wireless outages and 
support faster service restoration during emergencies like this one.  It has been absolutely critical that people have been able to be in contact.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
95 
 And, you know, one of the actions, of course, is requiring backup power sources 
for cell sites and infrastructure, and that has proved to be very important, as I really 
haven't had trouble reaching people, other than that they maybe can't keep their devices 
powered.  So those are huge challenges.  And I know that in response to Beryl, the FCC announced the activation of the Disaster Information Reporting System and for the first time this mandatory initiative.  
So, Chairwoman Rosenworcel, with the time that we have, can you just talk a little 
bit about why it was important for the FCC to move this from a voluntary program to a 
mandatory program?  And maybe just explain a little bit about what that will mean for 
my constituents, what some of the actions are that are required, and how in moments like this where we are really in crisis how your agency is working to help make sure that 
we have the resources and information that we need to stay in communication.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  Thank you.   
Everyone needs communication, and especially in crisis.  And, unfortunately, the 
Texas Gulf Coast has had more than its fair share of weather events, and as a result, we started the disaster system that takes in data about when services are down.  We also sent individuals down to the Houston area to work with FEMA on this.  We have a lot of people who do that work, they do it quietly.  They are real heroes.  They go and get some ground troops throughout the state of communications and help with restoration.   
And we also have a first test case of our Mandatory Disaster Response Initiative 
which requires carriers to work with one another and let their customers roam on each other's networks.  This was previously a volunteer initiative, but I went with Commissioner Carr after Hurricane Ida to Louisiana.  We spoke with a lot of public safety officials, and they convinced us both that this should be required.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
96 
 So after Hurricane Beryl leaves the Houston area, one thing we are going to do is 
find out how it worked, because we want to make sure it works for everyone going 
forward.  This is both a tragedy, but I think it is also an opportunity.  I think you are 
going to be able to demonstrate to us how our carriers worked with one another and kept people connected.  
Mrs. Fletcher.   Well, thank you so much for that.  And I have a little bit more 
time, so I also want to ask, one of the challenges we are seeing is, of course, keeping track of outages of all kinds, including the power outages.  But also, I know that the agency 
recently issued an order classifying broadband as Title II service that will give the FCC 
insight into network outages, and that will ultimately, I think, benefit people in my district and across the country.   
Can you just talk a little bit more about what that will mean?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  When broadband goes out, a community goes down.  
When it goes out in my house, you know, my children are ready for revolution.  It is one 
of those circumstances that affects everything in modern life.  It is why the Federal 
Communications Commission needs the authority to collect data about outages, not just in the aftermath of weather disasters, but also outages that occur when we least expect them.   
There was a community in Michigan that lost service during the pandemic for 
45 days, but the FCC had no data or information about it.  Now that we have Title II 
authority back, we will be able to collect information about outages, understand why they occur, and then take action to prevent them from occurring again, which is really, really important for all of us who count on the internet in our day -to-day life.  
Mrs. Fletcher.   Well, thank you so much for that.  And I am glad to hear about This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
97 
 how the commissioners are working together in this instance.   
I don't have time for another question, but with the 10  seconds I have left, I don't 
think I can close without mentioning my surprise that FCC officials that are nominated by 
the President and confirmed by the Senate are listed as contributors to the Project 2025 plan, which is really a blueprint for dismantling our government and eviscerating agencies like this one and others and fundamentally changing our country.  So I am surprised and very disappointed to see that.   
And with that, I yield back.  
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady's time has expired.   
The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Florida's Third District for 5  minutes 
for questioning.  
Mrs. Cammack.   Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you to our 
commissioners for appearing before us here today.  
I will start with you, Chairwoman.  In June, the chairman of the Federal Elections 
Commission sent you a letter regarding the FCC proposed regulations on AI and political advertisements.  Now, in the letter, Chairman Cooksey stated that the FCC lacks the legal authority to promulgate conflicting disclaimers requirements only for political communication.  He also stated that it would create confusion and disarray among political campaigns.   
Now, have you spoken to Chair Cooksey about this proposal, and do you plan to 
move forward following the FEC's concerns about the authority and political speech?   
And I apologize, I am in three conflicting hearings today, so if this has been asked, 
I appreciate you answering it again.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   First of all, I believe in transparency.  I believe every single This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
98 
 consumer should know if AI is being used.  I think it is good for truth, honesty, and 
safety that every single one of us knows if AI is being used.   
I spoke to the vice chair of the FEC who thinks that we have complementary 
authority here, because since 1930, the FCC has been requiring campaigns, when they advertise on television and radio, to file with us what ad they put up, when it ran, and how much they paid for it.   
In 1974, Congress --  
Mrs. Cammack.   No, wait.  Chairwoman?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   -- asked cable authorities to do that.  And then in 1992 --   
Mrs. Cammack.   I asked if you spoke with the chair, not the vice chair.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I have only spoken to the vice chair, but the truth is we have a 
long history.   
Mrs. Cammack.   So the chair and the vice chair have differing opinions on this.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Since 1930, we have been collecting this data in our files.  
Mrs. Cammack.   I am not trying to be adversarial.  I am just trying to get to the 
bottom of this.   
So there is a --  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Okay.  Fair.  So I have spoken to the vice chair --  
Mrs. Cammack.   There is a disconnect between the chair and the vice chair over 
at the FEC.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  They have a difference of opinion.  The vice chair 
says that, clearly, we have complementary authority in this area.  I agree with that.  
Mrs. Cammack.   So what is the plan, because we are less than 5  months out from 
a significant election?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
99 
 Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  Totally.  I agree with you, but what I have 
proposed  --  
Mrs. Cammack.   All of us being candidates, in addition  --  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Let's talk about what I proposed, because I feel like this 
conversation isn't about that.  What I have proposed is a rulemaking, a proposal that we 
collect public comment on whether or not advertisements that are run on our televisions and radios should just disclose if they use AI.  
Mrs. Cammack.   I think  --  
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady is asking a question.  
Mrs. Cammack.   Yes.  I don't think that that requires a whole comment period 
because, by and large, everyone wants transparency, right?  It is a matter of does the FCC have authority to do so.   
So, Commission Carr -- 
Ms. Rosenworcel.   We have laws since 19  --  
Mr. Latta.   No.  The gentlelady from Florida has the floor to ask.   
Mr. Carr.   The proposal that would have the FCC mark a monumental sea change 
in the regulation of political speech on the eve of a national election is as unlawful as it is misguided.  As the chairman of the FEC has made clear, Congress has given them exclusive authority with respect to disclosures involving political ads.  Moreover, the FCC can only muddy the waters here.  It would put in place a proposal that applies only to an 
ad on broadcast TV, but you could see the same ad online or on cable that wouldn't have 
the disclosure.  That is going to leave consumers less informed, perhaps more confused than they are today.   
So I think the FCC should abandon this proposal because it can only move forward This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
100  
 right on the eve of an election.  This is an important debate, the use of AI, no doubt, but 
that debate should be happening here in Congress, and it is happening at the FEC as well.  
It is just not a job for the FCC right now.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I don't know why we are so scared of --  
Mrs. Cammack.   I am sorry, I have to  -- I have to reclaim my time.   
Mr. Latta.   The gentlelady from Florida is asking the questions and has the floor.  
Mrs. Cammack.   Chairwoman, I have got to jump to another issue.   
Thank you, Commissioner Carr, for that feedback.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   No problem.  
Mrs. Cammack.   The 4.9 gigahertz band, as we know, very, very important, first 
responders public safety.  I want to get to a timeline for making a decision on whether 
this band will be reallocated to FirstNet or it will be auctioned.  Do we have that?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   We have an open docket on that.  We are taking in comment 
from all kinds of public safety authorities right now.  To be clear, it is not a question of 
whether it will go to FirstNet or be auctioned.  It is a question of what public safety 
authorities might be managing these airwaves going forward.  
Mrs. Cammack.   Timeline?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   My hope is that we can do this within the next several 
months, but, boy, lots of people are filing a lot of stuff before us.  And when it comes at us fast and furious, we have to spend some time looking at it and reading it carefully.   
Mrs. Cammack.   There is a lot more that I wish I could get to.  I wish you guys 
could see my notes here, or maybe not, I am not sure.  But I want to leave us in the last 22 seconds with this.  
I agree with you, Commissioner Carr, that this could severely muddy the waters This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
101  
 when we are talking about AI.  While I agree wholeheartedly that we need transparency 
and clarity about the use of AI in political advertisements, the FEC has jurisdiction over 
this issue.  And the fact that there are divided opinions, conflicting opinions within the 
FCC, that you have not spoken to the chair of the FEC, is concerning.   
So with that, my time has expired.  And, Mr. Chairman, I yield.   
Mr. Latta.   Thank you.  The gentlelady's time has expired.   
And the chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York, who is waiving on to 
the subcommittee, who is a member of the full committee.  
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you, Chair Latta and Ranking Member Matsui, for holding this 
hearing, and the chair and commissioners for your service in being here today.   
Before I go on with my questioning, Chair Rosenworcel, I think you wanted to 
make a statement in response to the AI issue yet.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   I just think transparency is a good thing, disclosing when AI 
use is a good thing.  And the FCC has authority in this area and has had authority since 
the 1930s.  
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you.   
Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have championed efforts to extend 
broadband access to unserved and underserved areas.  Last Congress, I was proud to 
support the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocated over $42 billion for high -speed 
broadband deployment nationwide.  With these historic investments, accurate 
broadband maps are essential for the equitable and effective allocation of Federal funds.   
Chairman Rosenworcel, I appreciated your work on behalf of my district, visiting 
the district and listening carefully to what my constituents had to say about this issue.  
And I appreciate your written testimony on the National Broadband Map, and commend This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
102  
 the FCC for the substantial progress made in updating these maps over the past few 
years.  However, in the Capital Region of New York, we are still seeing the effects of 
unreliable data.   
Communities often struggle with slow speeds, unreliable connections, or no 
service, despite being designated as having access.  This disparity can hamper economic 
development and perpetuate systemic inequalities, widening the digital divide.   
So can you speak please, Commissioner Chair, to  -- can you speak to how the FCC 
is incorporating consumer- reported data on broadband availability and quality into its 
mapping efforts and the role public feedback plays in efforts to refine our broadband maps?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  Public feedback is so important.  We built maps 
based on the Broadband DATA Act, which is bipartisan work of this committee.  Those maps are light years ahead of anything we have ever had before, and they are iterative.  They are improving all the time.   
The primary way that they improve is when consumers and State and local 
officials go on to that website and register a complaint or a criticism that says, you say there is service here, I am standing right in that location and, no, there is not.  And so I would encourage you to encourage your constituents to work with that map.  And I would be happy to set up times for them to discuss it with our broadband mapping team, because I know feedback from local individuals is the way we get this data right.  
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you so much.  And can you discuss how the FCC collaborates 
with other Federal agencies, State governments, and industry stakeholders to streamline broadband mapping efforts and ensure a cohesive approach to improving nationwide broadband access?   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
103  
 Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  It is a really, really big task, to be candid with you.  
When I got to the agency and I took over, one of the first things I did was said, okay, we 
are going to do better maps.  And then I studied it and I instantly know, understood why 
nobody had done it before.   
We had to build a data set of tax records, property records, satellite images that 
indicated where every single household is in the United States.  And then we had to build a system that was capable of taking in data from all of our carriers, and then feedback and crowdsourced information from local, State, Tribal, and consumers all 
telling us, what is going on.   
The system right now is terrific.  We have got 115 million households that we 
indicate where broadband is.  We know that in 6 million of them it is not present.  But 
it can always be improved.  That is why we update it every 6  months.  And coming out 
this week, in fact, is another rulemaking from the FCC that all my colleagues supported which asks questions about how we improve this process further to make sure we take 
into account smarter approaches to things like fixed wireless and technologies that may 
not have been at the forefront when the Broadband DATA Act was passed by this committee.  
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you.  Additionally, earlier this year, I was pleased to see your 
proposal to improve routing for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.  As a co -lead of the 
bipartisan 988 lifeline improvement act, I am committed to ensuring that callers in crisis 
receive access to locally relevant mental health resources.   
In May, the KFF released an analysis of the utilization of the 988 Suicide and Crisis 
Lifeline's LGBTQ service showing that 10  percent of all 988 outreach was made via the 
LGBTQ service, but only 20  percent of LGBTQ adults were even aware of the 988 service.   This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
104  
 So could you discuss any initiatives the FCC is undertaking to raise public 
awareness about the availability and purpose of 988, especially among vulnerable 
populations that may benefit most from the service?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Yeah.  Well, first things first, we are seeing substantial 
increases in the use of 988, the simple three -digit number.  More people understand it, 
more people know about it.  We are getting many more calls than we previously did 
under the 10 -digit number that was hard for folks to remember.   
We are going to have to work on publicizing it with mental health authorities.  
My colleagues and I have a lot of skills, but we are not mental health experts, so we have been coordinating with the Health and Human Services Department and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services agency there.  And going forward, we are going to work with them to make sure that calls are georouted; in other words, we get information off the cell tower so that when we send that 988 caller to a help center, they will be sent to assistance that is nearby.   
Mr. Tonko.   Thank you so much.   
And, Mr.  Chair, I yield back.  
Mr. Obernolte.   [Presiding.]  The gentleman yields back.   
I will recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions.   
Chair Rosenworcel, it is very nice to see you again.  I would like to continue a line 
of questioning that was started by my colleague from Florida, Mrs. Cammack, about the 
FCC's recent actions to put restrictions on the use of AI in political advertising.   
And to be clear, I don't think anyone disagrees with the importance of putting 
some guidelines in place.  I think everyone is disturbed by the thought that a campaign 
could run an ad with their opponent saying or doing something that they didn't actually This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be 
inaccurate, incomplete, or misattributed to the speaker.   
  
105  
 do with the use of AI to make that happen.  But we want to make sure that we get this 
done in the appropriate way.   
And Mrs. Cammack highlighted the fact that the chair of the FEC has objected to 
the FCC's use of your regulatory authority to do this, and so I just wanted to ask a couple questions about that.   
If the FCC has authority over broadcast television, so, ostensibly, if you 
implemented this rule, you could require a disclaimer on ads on broadcast, but could you require that same disclaimer on other channels, such as streaming services or social 
media?   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   To be clear, Congress has given us this authority for 
broadcast, radio, satellite, and cable.  That is a substantial portion of campaign ads.  
And we have exercised this authority as far back as 1938.  So this is the system everyone has used for decades.  Every single campaign reports when an ad was run, who paid for it.  And on air they say who is responsible for it.  So we are just behind this principle of 
transparency, which is you should simply say if AI was used.  It is nothing more 
complicated than that.  We are proposing transparency.  It is very simple.  Was AI used, yes or no?   
Mr. Obernolte.   Sure.  I understand that.  
Ms. Rosenworcel.   And separately, though, I want to just make one more point.  
We have these files for Federal, State, local, and issues.  In other words, it is a far 
greater community than what the Federal Election Commission oversees.  That is why 
the vice chair said we have complementary authorities in this area, and I agree.  
Mr. Obernolte.   So here is a concern that I have, which is that if the FCC imposes 
this requirement but that requirement is not mirrored by requirements on other This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 channels, such as social media and streaming services, then the public could become 
desensitized when they see an ad on one of those other channels that lacks that 
disclosure because they assume, they make the assumption that the disclosure applies to 
all the channels equally.  And that is why we want to make sure that we get this right.   
This is actually an issue that the Artificial Intelligence Task Force here in the House 
has discussed.  And I can tell you that the implementation of it is more complicated than merely requiring a disclosure, because you have to talk about what AI is and what it isn't, what it has been used for and what it hasn't.  And the example you and I were talking 
about absolutely 100  percent is something that not only should require disclosure, it 
should not be allowed, in my opinion.   
But the use of AI being  -- to choose the opposite end of the extreme --  to clean up 
the audio of a candidate in a speech, which also occurs, is something that is completely 
benign and might not even require disclosure.  So the devil is in the details.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   Sure.  So I just want to say, I completely agree with you.  
This is complicated.  I would be very happy to have a conversation about that, but it is very clear that transparency is a good thing, we have authority here, and also that you have got to start somewhere.  Our proposal is just a request for public comment.  And when you think about AI and the confusion involved and the complexities of these issues, asking for public comment about an issue of transparency is a good thing.  
Mr. Obernolte.   Right.  I would agree.  And let's work together to make sure 
that this happens.  We want to make sure it happens in a way that solves the problem completely so it applies to all the channels of communication and solves the problem comprehensively in a way that doesn't devolve into different agencies arguing over does the FCC have the authority, does the FEC, has Congress delegated this authority.

 know what, let's get the problem solved by working together.   
Ms. Rosenworcel.   And, listen, I think our public  -- and I think our Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking that I proposed can open up a dialogue for just that.  We can in 
public discuss these issues; try to refine the kind of definitions that you just described, /understand what applies to Federal elections, State elections, local elections issue campaigns; and make sure that we come up with something that is simple and that people can trust; and just puts transparency front and center for the American public.  I think we are all capable of doing that, and I think that is what our proposal was designed 
to do.  
Mr. Obernolte.   Let's work together on that.  
Mr. Carr.   Yeah.  This is not something that we should be rushing through on 
the eve of an election.  As you noted, it is complex.  You have got deceptive deep fakes 
on the one hand, you have got the use of ChatGPT to run scripts for ads on the other end.  This is something that Congress is taking a serious look at.  It is complicated.  We 
shouldn't be rushing this through before an election.  
Mr. Obernolte.   Commissioner Carr, I appreciate your engagement on that.  My 
point about the different channels I stole from your testimony, so thank you very much 
for being engaged on that.  
My time has expired.   
Seeing no further members waiting to be recognized, I would like to thank our 
witnesses for being here today.  I think this has been a very useful exercise in not only the separation of powers but our ability to work together.  And means a lot to me that you are willing to come here and testify.  
I would ask unanimous consent to insert in the record the documents included in This is an unedited transcript.  The statements within may be

 the staff hearing documents list.  Without objection, that will be the order.  
I remind members that they have 10 business days to submit questions for the 
record, and I ask the witnesses to respond to the questions promptly, and I know you will.  
Members should submit their questions by the close of business on Tuesday, July  23.   
Without objection, the subcommittee is now adjourned.
